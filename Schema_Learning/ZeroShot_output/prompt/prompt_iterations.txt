**Prompt:**
Your task is to extract the hierarchical structure from newly provided paragraphs and continue building / extending old hierarchical structure based on newly extracted hierarchical structure. The final output of your task should be a new hierarchical structure with both information/knowledge from old hierarchical structure and newly provided paragraphs.

Old hierarchical structure is:
###
{}.format(Current hierarchical structure)
###

The provided new paragraphs:
###
{}_Paragraphs_provided
###

### Hierarchical Structure Guidelines:

- **Event**: Anything that happens related to the EV battery supply chain.
- **Event ID**: A unique identifier for each event.
- **Description**: A detailed 2-3 sentence explanation of the event.
- **Participants**: All sub-events related to this event and their importance, the importance needs to be set as 0 ~ 1, the higher the more important.
- **Gate**: The relationship between an event and its sub-events:
  - Use **'and'** if no sub-events can be missing.
  - Use **'or'** if some sub-events can be missing.
  - Use **'xor'** if sub-events cannot exist simultaneously.
- **Relations**: The event-event relations (e.g., ev1.1>ev1.2, which means ev1.2 happens after ev1.1).
- If any level is empty, set its value to 'xxxx'.

### Steps to Build the Hierarchical Structure:

1. **Identify Events**: Extract events from the new paragraphs.
2. **Assign Event IDs**: Ensure each event has a unique identifier.
3. **Describe Events**: Provide a detailed 2-3 sentence description for each event.
4. **List Participants**: Identify and list all subevents with their importances.
5. **Determine Gates**: Specify the relationship between events and their subevents (and/or/xor).
6. **Define Relations**: Specify any event-event relations, setting to 'xxxx' if none.

### Example:

**Input Paragraph**:
```
Three main methods are used in lithium-ion recycling: pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgical, bioleaching, and direct recycling [67,68,69]. The battery is melted in a hot furnace to recover some of the cathode metal in pyrometallurgy. Pyrometallurgy employs extreme heat to transform metal oxides into cobalt, copper, iron, and nickel alloys. Although it has a straightforward process and a reasonably mature technology, the main drawbacks are its high cost and high environmental pollution. Hydrometallurgy is a metal recovery method involving aqueous solutions to perform leaching processes to precipitate a particular metal. In hydrometallurgy, specialized solution reagents are primarily used to leach the targeted metals out from the cathode substance [70]. Although it is a highly effective and power-efficient method, its drawbacks include a lengthy production time and a complicated process. Combinations of both pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy are also used due to their advantages in sorting starting materials for cells. The bioleaching technique uses bacteria to retrieve precious metals, but it is challenging because the bacteria need a substantial amount of time to grow and are easily susceptible to contamination.

Let’s think about this extracted structure step by step:
Starting with the first sentence in the paragraph ‘Three main methods are used in lithium-ion recycling: pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgical, bioleaching, and direct recycling [67,68,69].’ From this sentence, we can learn that ‘pyrometallurgical’, ‘hydrometallurgical’, ‘bioleaching, and direct recycling’ are three methods of ‘lithium-ion recycling’, so select ‘lithium-ion recycling’ as event, and the three methods as subevent and participants of ‘lithium-ion recycling’.

Please extract the hierarchical information from newly provided paragraphs and continue building / extending current hierarchical structure based on newly extracted hierarchical information.

And you need to output the whole hierarchical structure you have now!!!
