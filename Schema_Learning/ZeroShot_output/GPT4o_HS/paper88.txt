Event 1
event: Methodology for lithium supply and demand analysis
event_id: ev1
description: The methodology for analyzing lithium supply and demand includes three main steps: data collection, system dynamics modeling, and scenario building. These steps aim to understand the historical supply of lithium and forecast future demand.
