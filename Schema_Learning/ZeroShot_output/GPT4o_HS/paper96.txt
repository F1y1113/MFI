Event 1
event: EV battery supply chain configurations
event_id: ev1
description: Analysis of different configurations in the EV battery supply chain reveals various cost and logistical implications.
participants: Scenario A ev1.1_P1, Scenario B ev1.2_P1, Scenario C ev1.3_P1, Scenario D ev1.4_P1

Relations: ev1.1>ev1.2, ev1.1>ev1.3, ev1.1>ev1.4, ev1.2>ev1.3, ev1.2>ev1.4, ev1.3>ev1.4

Subevent 1.1
subevent: Scenario A
event_id: ev1.1
description: Scenario A has the highest unit cost due to the Advanced Warehouse being 20 km away from the plant, requiring dedicated trips.
participants: Advanced Warehouse ev1.1.1_P1, Plant ev1.1.2_P1, Buffer Warehouse ev1.1.3_P1
Gate: and
Relations: ev1.1.1>ev1.1.2, ev1.1.1>ev1.1.3

Subevent 1.2
subevent: Scenario B
event_id: ev1.2
description: Scenario B is cheaper than Scenario A as the Advanced Warehouse is inside the production site, but space constraints require plant layout redesign.
participants: Advanced Warehouse ev1.2.1_P1, Plant ev1.2.2_P1, Redesigned Plant Layout ev1.2.3_P1
Gate: and
Relations: ev1.2.1>ev1.2.2, ev1.2.2>ev1.2.3

Subevent 1.3
subevent: Scenario C
event_id: ev1.3
description: Scenario C is more expensive than Scenario B but cheaper than Scenario A, with batteries directly sent to the production line from the Advanced Warehouse located 20 km away.
participants: Advanced Warehouse ev1.3.1_P1, Plant ev1.3.2_P1, Direct Truck Transport ev1.3.3_P1
Gate: and
Relations: ev1.3.1>ev1.3.2, ev1.3.1>ev1.3.3

Subevent 1.4
subevent: Scenario D
event_id: ev1.4
description: Scenario D is the cheapest configuration with a direct connection between the supplier plant and the production line but is the most risky due to the 2,000 km distance.
participants: Supplier Plant ev1.4.1_P1, Production Line ev1.4.2_P1, Direct Connection ev1.4.3_P1
