# Hierarchical Structure

## Overview 

The hierarchical stucture (hs) text files provide a hierarchical representation of the events and subevents involved in the Electric Vehicle (EV) Battery Supply Chain. The relationships between these events, including the order of processes and their respective participants, are clearly outlined.

## Structure

The hs files are organized into main events and several subevents and subsubevents, each with a detailed description, participants, and relationships to other events. The hierarchical structure is as follows:

- **Main Event**: This is the overarching event that encompasses the entire supply chain, from material mining to battery recycling.
- **Subevents**: These represent significant stages within the main event, such as Material Mining, Raw Material Processing, and Battery Pack Production.
- **Subsubevents**: These further break down the subevents into specific processes, such as Lithium Mining, Nickel Mining, and Cathode Manufacturing.

## Note

- Some subevents and subsubevents are incomplete (marked as xxxx), indicating areas where additional details or research may be required.
- The relationships described in this file assume a typical flow of events in the EV Battery Supply Chain and may vary depending on specific industry practices.
