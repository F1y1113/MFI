Event 1
event: ZincPower supply chain structure
event_id: ev1
description: The supply chain structure for ZincPower involves two sales channels for zinc-nickel batteries: traditional retail sales and simultaneous renting and selling. ZincPower and downstream retailers form a Stackelberg game with ZincPower as the leader, and consumers strategically choose channels based on their utility.
