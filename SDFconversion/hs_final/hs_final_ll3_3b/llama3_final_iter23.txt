Now, let's extract the hierarchical information from the new paragraphs:

**New Paragraphs**:
```
Trends in battery production have led to renewed efforts by a number of advanced countries to promote the development of a domestic battery manufacturing capacity (supply chain risks have risen up the political agenda due in part to the COVID-19 crisis and deteriorating Sino-US relations). The European Union, for example, has set a target of having at least 50% of its electricity come from renewable sources by 2030. In addition, many countries are actively pursuing the development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

The main challenge in promoting the widespread adoption of electric vehicles is the lack of charging infrastructure. Many people do not have access to charging points near their homes or workplaces, which makes it difficult for them to consider purchasing an electric vehicle. Governments and private companies are working together to address this issue by building out a comprehensive network of charging stations.

China has been at the forefront of the development of electric vehicles, with many major manufacturers based there. The Chinese government has also been actively promoting the adoption of electric vehicles through policies such as tax incentives and subsidies for purchasing an electric vehicle.
