Here is a step-by-step process of how I extracted the hierarchical information from the new paragraphs:

1. **Identify Events**: Extract events from the paragraphs, which are:
	* Nickel mine
	* Geology
	* Hydrometallurgical process
	* Bioleaching method

2. **Assign Event IDs**: Ensure each event has a unique identifier. I assigned the following IDs:
	* ev2.0: Nickel mine
	* ev2.1: Geology
	* ev2.2: Hydrometallurgical process
	* ev2.3: Bioleaching method

3. **Describe Events**: Write a brief description for each event.
4. **Participants**: Identify the participants involved in each event, which are:
	* Nickel ev2.0.1_P1: nickel production
	* Mine ev2.0.2_P0.5: mining activities
	* (none specified for geology)
	* (none specified for hydrometallurgical process and bioleaching method)

5. **Gate**: Determine the gate condition for each event, which is:
	* Nickel mine: and (nickel production and mining activities)

6. **Relations**: Identify any relationships between events or subevents, which are:
	* ev2.1>ev2.2: Geology leads to hydrometallurgical process
	* ev2.1>ev2.3: Geology also leads to bioleaching method
