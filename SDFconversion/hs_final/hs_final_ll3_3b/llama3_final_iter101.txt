Event 1: ev2 (Develop expertise...)
* Event 2: ev3 (Enable players...)

**Event Description**

I'll provide detailed descriptions for each event:

1. Event 1:
description: India needs to develop expertise at large-scale battery pack assembly with BMS under the 'Skill India' initiatives.
2. Event 2:
description: This will enable players to set-up a long-term, sustainable LIB production ecosystem and facilitate employment generation.

**Participants**

I'll identify subevents and their probabilities for each event:

1. Event 1:
participants: ev2.1_P1 (Develop expertise at large-scale battery pack assembly with BMS)
2. Event 2:
participants: ev3.1_P1 (Enable players to set-up a long-term, sustainable LIB production ecosystem)

**Gates**

I'll specify the relationships between events and their subevents:

1. Event 1:
gate: or
2. Event 2:
gate: and

**Relations**

There are no event-event relations.

Here's the updated hierarchical structure:
