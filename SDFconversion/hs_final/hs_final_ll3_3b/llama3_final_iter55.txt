Event 2
event: developing a model for E V battery CLSC
event_id: ev2
description: This paper develops the model based on the reality that most manufacturers and remanufacturers make decisions based on their own interests, the profit.

Event 3
event: implication of research results to practitioners
event_id: ev3
description: The implication of the research results to practitioners have threefold: (1) Special attention needs to be paid on low-quality returns as it has more significant impact on total profit; (2) Although high-quality return is encouraged, monetary incentive to obtain high-quality returns may not necessarily work; (3) To sustain recycling business, government support is vitally important to keep the business going.

Event 4
event: reusing returned batteries does not bring economic benefits
event_id: ev4
description: Our model suggests that reusing returned batteries does not bring economic benefits. How to realize the benefits for the environment and the economy at same time needs further investigation.

The combined hierarchical structure now includes four events (lithium-ion recycling, developing a model for E V battery CLSC, implication of research results to practitioners, and reusing returned batteries does not bring economic benefits). The relationships between these events are as follows:

* Event 1 (lithium-ion recycling) has subevents pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgy, and bioleaching.
* Event 2 (developing a model for E V battery CLSC) is related to Event 1 through the relationship ev1>ev2.
* Event 3 (implication of research results to practitioners) is related to Events 1 and 2 through the relationships ev1>ev3 and ev2>ev3. The implication also has three subevents: special attention needs to be paid on low-quality returns, although high-quality return is encouraged, and government support is vitally important to keep the business going.
