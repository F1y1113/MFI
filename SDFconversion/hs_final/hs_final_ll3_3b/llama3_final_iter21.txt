Subevent 1.1
subevent: Case study of a niche EV manufacturer (EV-Co)
event_id: ev2
description: This case study encompasses the EV manufacturer's suppliers of those drivetrain-related components that most distinguish the EV from an ICE vehicle.
participants: EV-Co, suppliers of drivetrain-related components (e.g. motor, battery, fuel cells, and electronic control units)
Gate: or
