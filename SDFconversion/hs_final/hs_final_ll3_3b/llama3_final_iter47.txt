Once I receive the new paragraphs, I will:

1. **Identify Events**: Extract events from the new paragraphs.
2. **Assign Event IDs**: Ensure each event has a unique identifier.
3. **Describe Events**: Provide a detailed 2-3 sentence description for each event.
4. **List Participants**: Identify and list all subevents with their probabilities.
5. **Determine Gates**: Specify the relationship between events and their subevents (and/or/xor).
6. **Define Relations**: Specify any event-event relations, setting to 'xxxx' if none.

After completing these steps, I will output the whole hierarchical structure, including the new extracted information.
