Downstream activities include manufacturing of the batteries and end goods for the consumer.[3] The production of lithium batteries in China has nearly three times higher emissions than the US because electricity generation in China relies more on coal.[2]

End of life activities include recycling or recovery of materials when possible.[3]

Disposal of spent LIBs without recycling could be detrimental to the environment.[2] Recycling lithium-ion batteries reduces energy consumption, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and results in 51.3% natural resource savings when compared to discarding them in landfills.[8] Recycling can potentially lower the overall energy emissions of battery production as the LIB recycling industry grows larger.[2] When not recycled, the disposal of cobalt extraction involves non-sulfidic tailings, which has an impact on land use.[15] Even in the recycling process, CO2 emissions are still produced, continuing to impact the environment regardless of how LIBs are disposed.[2]

Recycling of battery minerals is limited but is expected to rise in the 2030s when there are more spent batteries. Increasing recycling would bring considerable social and environmental benefits.

Countries roles in the supply chain:
China dominates the electric car industry, accounting for three-quarters of global lithium-ion battery production. Most refining of lithium, cobalt, and graphite takes place in China. Japan and Korea host significant midstream cell manufacturing and downstream supply chain activities. Europe and the United States have a relatively small share of the supply chain.[1]

In 2021, 3.3 million EVs were sold in China, up 40% from 2020, and accounting for nearly 60% of global electric vehicle sales.[1] The growth of the electric vehicle market is expected to continue, with forecasts suggesting that by 2040, there will be over 140 million electric vehicles on the road.

Environmental impacts:
The extraction of lithium, cobalt, and graphite can have significant environmental impacts. Lithium mining, for instance, can contaminate water sources and harm local ecosystems.[2]
