The process begins with disassembling the spent lithium-ion batteries into components. The goal is to recover as much of the valuable materials like cobalt, copper, nickel, and graphite as possible [1]. To achieve this, the battery's casing is removed, followed by disassembly of the cathode, anode, electrolyte, and other components.

The recovered materials are then processed through a series of steps. First, the materials are crushed into smaller particles to increase their surface area. Next, the particles are mixed with chemicals that help extract the valuable metals.

Let's think about this extracted structure step by step:
From the first sentence in the paragraph 'The process begins with disassembling the spent lithium-ion batteries into components.' we can learn that there are two main methods for recycling lithium-ion batteries: one is to disassemble the battery, and another is material processing. We select 'lithium-ion battery disassembly and recycling process' as event, and disassembling the spent lithium-ion batteries and material processing as subevent and participants of ‘lithium-ion battery disassembly and recycling process’.


From this structure, you can see that it contains hierarchical information about different events ('lithium-ion battery disassembly and recycling process', 'disassembling the spent lithium-ion batteries into components', etc.) and their corresponding participants, descriptions, gates (AND or OR), and relations.
