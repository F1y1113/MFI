Event 1: lithium-ion recycling (ev1)
Event 2: supply and demand balance curve in economics (ev2)
Event 3: supply risk analysis for critical raw materials (ev3)
Event 4: supply chain constraints for power lithium batteries (ev4)
Event 5: growth rate of lithium-ion batteries (ev5)

These events are connected by their descriptions, participants, gates, and relations.

The hierarchical structure is as follows:

Event 1 > Subevent 1.1
Event 2 > Subevent 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
Event 3 > Subevent 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
Event 4 > Subevent 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
Event 5 > None

This structure captures the hierarchical relationships between the events and their subevents.
