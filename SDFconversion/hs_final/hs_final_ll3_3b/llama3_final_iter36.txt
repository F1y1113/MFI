Event 1**
event: Japan's cobalt demand-supply imbalance
event_id: ev1
description: Although the cobalt demand for Japan is much lower than that for other regions, the limited domestic cobalt reserves and overseas reserve ownership lead to a relatively higher supply risk in Japan.
participants: limited domestic cobalt reserves ev1.1_P0.5, overseas reserve ownership ev1.2_P0.5

**Event 2**
event: Japan's hydrogen society ambition
event_id: ev2
description: Japanâ€™s ambition to build a â€˜hydrogen societyâ€™ signifies a preference for fuel cell vehicles (cobalt-free vehicles) in the transportation system instead of BEVs and PHEVs.
participants: fuel cell vehicles ev2.1_P0.5, BEVs ev2.2_P0.25, PHEVs ev2.3_P0.25

**Event 3**
event: Study on cobalt demand-supply imbalance
event_id: ev3
description: Our study primarily investigated the extent to which battery and recycling technology progress can relieve the global and regional cobalt demandâ€“supply imbalance in the coming decades.
participants: battery technology ev3.1_P0.5, recycling technology ev3.2_P0.25

**Event 4**
event: PEVs and EBs in electric mobility transition
event_id: ev4
description: Due to data gaps, the absolute results should be interpreted with caution and with unavoidable uncertainties in mind. First, only PEVs and EBs are included for the electric mobility transition.
participants: PEVs ev4.1_P0.5, EBs ev4.2_P0.25

Relations: ev4.1>ev4.2

**Event 5**
event: EoL management and circular economy strategies
event_id: ev5
description: Nevertheless, we believe our scenario results still provide robust conclusions about the characteristics of global and regional historical and future cobalt cycles.
participants: EoL management ev5.1_P0.5, circular economy strategies ev5.2_P0.25
