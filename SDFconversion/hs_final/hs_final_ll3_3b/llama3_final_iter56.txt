Event 2
event: cobalt mining and pricing scenario
event_id: ev2
description: Cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with primary purpose being copper or iron ore production. Cobalt harvesting rates are not a factor of demand or pricing, but rather dependent on demand and pricing of co-extracted minerals.
participants: 
- Democratic Republic of Congo ev2.1_P1 (primary purpose is the production of copper or iron ore)
- Copper ev2.2_P0.5 (co-extracted mineral)
- Iron ore ev2.3_P0.5 (co-extracted mineral)
Gate: and
Relations: ev2>ev1 (the price increase in cobalt is due to expectations surrounding battery industry demand)
