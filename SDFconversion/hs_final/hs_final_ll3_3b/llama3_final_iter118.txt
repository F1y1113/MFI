description: Has less uncertainty due to observable data across material extraction, refining, and cathode production.
participants: observable data ev1.1.1_P1, refined cobalt ev1.1.2_P0.5
Gate: and
Relations: ev1.1.1>ev1.1.2

Subevent 1.2
subevent: NMC supply chain
event_id: ev1.2
description: Has substantial uncertainty due to unobserved intranational flows, indirect trade, and unobserved international trade.
participants: unobserved data ev1.2.1_P0.5, refined cobalt ev1.2.2_P0.5
Gate: or
Relations: ev1.2.1>ev1.2.2

Subevent 1.3
