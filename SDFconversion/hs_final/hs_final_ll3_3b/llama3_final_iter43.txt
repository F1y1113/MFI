1.
Your task is to extract the hierarchical structure from newly provided paragraphs and continue building / extending current hierarchical structure based on newly extracted hierarchical information. From the perspective of resources accessibility, efforts are required to understand the real and tangible costs of using critical raw materials, along with alternatives to mitigate these impacts with strategies such as recycling and substitution.

2.
Similar to the results by SantillÃ¥n-Saldivar et al. (2020) on the GeoPolEndpoint method, the relative contribution to the supply risk of aluminum, cobalt, copper, and nickel can be considered stable over the analyzed period. However, cobalt stands out as having the highest supply risk among the analyzed resources, a reflection of its which includes countries with perceived high geopolitical risk at the early stages (DR Congo and China). The transition to an endpoint level highlights the relevance of cobalt in the economic damages associated with resource use. Nickel appears also with a smaller share attributable to a high contribution in mass and relatively high geopolitical supply risk. For the case of NMC-LIB, the effect of the use of cobalt displaces the contribution of other resources, making them negligible in comparison. A question remains on how these compare to other environmental impacts at the midpoint and endpoint levels.

3.
Specifically for the comparison between abiotic depletion potential and the supply risk,
cobalt and aluminum gain higher visibility when using the characterization model based
on the GeoPolRisk method. This is because both cobalt and aluminum exhibit relatively high scores in terms of their contribution to the overall supply risk, with cobalt being the most prominent one.
