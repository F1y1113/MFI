Subevent 1.2
subevent: hydrometallurgical
event_id: ev1.2
description: Uses aqueous solutions to leach targeted metals out from the cathode substance.

Subevent 1.3
subevent: bioleaching
event_id: ev1.3
description: Uses bacteria to retrieve precious metals, but it is challenging because the bacteria need a substantial amount of time to grow and are easily susceptible to contamination.
participants: bacteria ev1.3.1_P0.7, contamination ev1.3.2_P0.3
