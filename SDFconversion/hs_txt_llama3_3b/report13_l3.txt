Event 1
event: lithium-ion recycling
event_id: ev1
description: Methods for recycling lithium-ion batteries including pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgical, bioleaching, and direct recycling.
participants: [pyrometallurgical] ev1.1_P0.333, [hydrometallurgical] ev1.2_P0.333, [bioleaching] ev1.3_P0.334

Subevent 1.1
subevent: pyrometallurgical
event_id: ev1.1
description: The battery is melted in a hot furnace to recover some of the cathode metal.
participants: [metal oxides] ev1.1.1_P0.5, [cobalt] ev1.1.2_P0.25, [copper] ev1.1.3_P0.25, [iron] ev1.1.4_P0.25, [nickel alloys] ev1.1.5_P0.25

Subevent 1.2
subevent: hydrometallurgical
event_id: ev1.2
description: In hydrometallurgy, specialized solution reagents are primarily used to leach the targeted metals out from the cathode substance.
participants: [specialized solution reagents] ev1.2.1_P0.5, [targeted metals] ev1.2.2_P0.5
Gate: and
Relations: ev1.2.1>ev1.2.2

Subevent 1.3
subevent: bioleaching
event_id: ev1.3
description: The bioleaching technique uses bacteria to retrieve precious metals, but it is challenging because the bacteria need a substantial amount of time to grow and are easily susceptible to contamination.
participants: [bacteria] ev1.3.1_P0.25, [precious metals] ev1.3.2_P0.75
