Event 1
event: For geothermal or oilfield brines to succeed as a source of lithium supply, a proven process for DLE will be required.
event_id: ev1
description: A number of companies testing various DLE approaches. While their ideas differ, the concept remains the same: letting the brine flow through a lithium-bonding material using adsorption, ion-exchange, membrane-separation, or solvent-extraction processes, followed by a polishing solution to obtain lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide.
participants: companies ev1.1_P1, DLE approaches ev1.2_P1, brine ev1.3_P0.5, lithium-bonding material ev1.4_P0.5
