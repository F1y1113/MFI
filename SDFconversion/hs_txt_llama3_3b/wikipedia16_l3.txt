Event 1
event: Green economy as a new boom of lithium extractivism
event_id: ev1
description: As mentioned above, lithium demand for the manufacture of rechargeable batteries doubled in less than ten years (USGS, 2012, 2016, 2020), a process directly related to carbon mitigation policies (c.f. Gobel, 2013; Fornillo, 2019; Observatorio Plurinacional de Salares Andinos, 2021). This boom's dark side is new pressure to expand lithium extractivism in the high Andean salt flats in Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile.
