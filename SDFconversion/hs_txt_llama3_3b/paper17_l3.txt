Subevent 2.2
subevent: hydrometallurgy
event_id: ev2.2

Subevent 2.3
subevent: bioleaching
event_id: ev2.3
description: The bioleaching technique uses bacteria to retrieve precious metals, but it is challenging because the bacteria need a substantial amount of time to grow and are easily susceptible to contamination.
