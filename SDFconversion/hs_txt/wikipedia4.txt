Event 1
event: Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxides (NMC)
event_id: ev1
description: Lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides (NMC) are mixed metal oxides used as the positively charged cathode in lithium-ion batteries for mobile devices and electric vehicles. NMC is notable for its high energy density, operating voltage, and efforts to reduce cobalt content due to ethical and cost concerns.

Subevent 1.2
subevent: Optimization for EVs
event_id: ev1.2
description: There is a focus on optimizing NMC for electric vehicle applications due to its high energy density and operating voltage. Efforts are being made to reduce the cobalt content in NMC because of ethical mining issues and high costs, while increasing nickel content to provide more capacity.

Subevent 1.3
subevent: Usage in Electric Vehicles
event_id: ev1.3
description: Many electric cars use NMC cathode batteries. Examples include the BMW ActiveE and BMW i8. Tesla, however, uses nickel cobalt aluminum oxide and lithium iron phosphate batteries for their vehicles. Tesla's home storage product, the Powerwall, uses NMC to increase the number of charge/discharge cycles over its lifetime.
