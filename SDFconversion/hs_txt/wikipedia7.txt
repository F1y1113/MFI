Event 1
event: Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminium Oxides (NCA)
event_id: ev1
description: Lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxides (NCA) are a group of mixed metal oxides used as active materials in the positive electrode (cathode) of lithium-ion batteries. NCA batteries are utilized in electric cars and electric appliances due to their high voltage range and specific composition.
