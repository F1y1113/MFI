Event 1
event: Circular value chain (CVC) of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)
event_id: ev1
description: The handling of end-of-life lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial due to their high remaining capacity. This review discusses the circular value chain (CVC) of spent LIBs and proposes the 5R principle: reduce, redesign, remanufacturing, repurpose, and recycling. It also covers state-of-the-art technologies, key issues, and future challenges for sustainable CVC.
