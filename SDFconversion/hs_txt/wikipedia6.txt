Event 1
event: Sodium-ion Battery Development
event_id: ev1
description: Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) emerged as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their cost-effectiveness, natural abundance, and safer materials. These batteries use sodium ions as charge carriers and have gained significant academic and commercial interest in the 2010s and early 2020s.

Subevent 1.1
subevent: Construction Principles
event_id: ev1.1
description: Sodium-ion batteries work on principles similar to lithium-ion batteries but replace lithium with sodium as the intercalating ion. The chemical properties of sodium are similar to lithium due to their position in the same group in the periodic table, but SIBs can differ significantly in some cases, such as with aqueous batteries.
