Event 1
event: Commercialization and development of LIBs
event_id: ev1
description: Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) were first commercialized by Sony in 1991. A typical battery pack contains modules and cells of various designs, but all LIB cells share basic components. Initial LIB cells used lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) chemistry, which has since been replaced by lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) and lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA) chemistries.
