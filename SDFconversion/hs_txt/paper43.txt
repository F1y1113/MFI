Event 1
event: Evolution of LiB Production Network
event_id: ev1
description: The evolution of the lithium-ion battery (LiB) production network requires an approach capturing the interaction and political-economic organization across existing supply chains. The Global Production Network (GPN) approach provides a more holistic understanding of these dynamics.
