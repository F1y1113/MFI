Lithium-ion batteries (LIBS) have been widely used in electric vehicles due to the advantages of high energy/power densities, high reliability and long life. However, considering that a massive number of LIBS will likely retire and enter the waste stream in the near future, the handling of end-of-life LIBS must be taken carefully. The effective utilization of retired LIBs, which still remain about 70-80% of the initial capacity, can extend battery life, conserve natural resources and protect the environment. Herein, this review provides a systematic discussion on the circular value chain (CVC) of spent LIBs, and proposes a 5R principle entailing reduce, redesign, remanufacturing, repurpose and recycling in the CVC process. Then the state-of-the-art technologies for remanufacturing, and a thorough summary of key issues and applications of repurpose process, are presented in detail. Subsequently, this article presents a comprehensive discussion on the recycling process, including pre-treatments and mainstream recycling technologies, from the prospects of technical, economic and regulation perspectives. Advanced technologies such as big data, block chain and cloud-based services, as well as the improvement of regulation and standardization processes, are required to solve the issues. Finally, the future challenges and prospects for sustainable CVC are highlighted.
