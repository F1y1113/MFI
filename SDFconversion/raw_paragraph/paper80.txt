The Department of Energy estimates the U.S. was home to eight percent of global EV lithium-ion cell manufacturing in 2020 with 59 GWh [27]. Since then, automakers have increased their commitments to support domestic EV manufacturing. In the first six months of 2022, 35 percent of all battery manufacturing jobs to date in the United States were announced and four of the top five largest facilities in the U.S. were announced in the past 12 months. Through the end of June 2022, automakers announced more than 1 15,000 jobs and $82.1 billion in investment for EV manufacturing in the United States.

In September 2021 , Ford and battery manufacturer SK Innovation together announced plans to invest $11 billion to build batteries and assemble EVs in Kentucky and Tennessee. According to Ford, this project will create 11 ,OOO jobs between the two states and would be the largest private investment in Kentucky's history [28]. The investment will fund the production of the F-150 Lightning, the electric version of the top-selling vehicle in the country. As part of the announcement, Ford also announced a plan to collaborate with Redwood Materials on a closed-loop battery recycling system.

In December 2021 , Toyota invested $1.2 billion in a new North Carolina battery production facility that will come online in 2025. The facility will create as many as 1,750 jobs and will be able to deliver enough lithium-ion batteries for up to 1.2 million EVs per year. In addition, in December 2021, Rivian announced a $5 billion investment in the company's second vehicle assembly plant outside of Atlanta, Georgia, that it says will eventually create 7,500 jobs. The Governor of Georgia lauded the initiative as the largest economic development project in the state's history. A few months later, Hyundai set a new record with the announcement of a facility to support 8, 100 jobs in the state to build batteries and assemble EVs. Other key components of the supply chain for EVs — including Electric Motors (AC) and inverters — must be scaled up to meet surging demand for EVs.

Estimates for the future price of batteries, even from the most credible sources, have been imperfect. Many experts historically underestimated the impact that economies of scale and efficiency gains would have on cell costs. Looking ahead, it is important to treat price projections with caution as many variables determine future costs and supply chain challenges have the potential to slow or reverse price drops. However, estimates still provide insight into price direction and economic patterns for the battery market.

Supply chain slowdowns and rising input costs are affecting all battery chemistries. As a result, the average cost per kWh may not fall below $100 until 2024[2]. In 2021 , battery packs experienced a modest 6 percent drop from the year prior —far from the 35 percent plummet between 2014 and 2015. Looking forward, in March 2021, the National Academies of Sciences (NAS) estimated that costs would drop further to $65-$80 kWh in 2030[24]. In addition to the rising cost of raw materials, demand from adjacent industries including stationary batteries could put pressure on battery prices. BNEF estimates_that worldwide battery energy storage system deployment will demand as much as 1 ,028 GWh by 2030 (up from 17 to 34 GWh in 2020) [43].
