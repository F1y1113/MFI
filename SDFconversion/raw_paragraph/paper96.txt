According to the results obtained by the analysis, some differences come up among the identified different configurations that have been considered in the study. Scenario A shows the highest unit cost. This is due to the fact that the Advanced Warehouse is located 20 km away from the plant. Thus, dedicated trips from the Advanced Warehouse to the plant are required. In addition, inside the production site there is another small warehouse as a buffer for the production to guarantee the operations of the production line in case of bad events. In Scenario B, the Advanced Warehouse is located inside the production site. Thus, batteries have to travel a distance equal to only 1 km to reach the line. Therefore, this configuration is cheaper compared with the previous one, but there are some space constraints. In fact, the current plant layout of the car manufacturer should be redesigned to host this new warehouse, since the space for the facility has not been established yet. In Scenario C, batteries coming from the Advance Warehouse are downloaded from trucks and directly sent to the production line. This scenario is more expensive than Scenario B because as in Scenario A the Advanced Warehouse is located at about 20 km away from the manufacturing plant. However, it is cheaper than Scenario A, there is not buffer storage close to the production line. Finally, Scenario D that is based on a direct connection between the supplier plant and the production line turns to the cheapest one. This is due to the fact that there is no Advanced Warehouse, and consequently a smaller number of batteries handling activities need to be performed. However Scenario D appears to be the most risky in terms of supply, since the battery manufacturer is located about 2,000 km far away from the production plant, and in the case of un-forecasted events such as bad weather conditions or truck breakdown, the provision of batteries could be interrupted.
