Subevent 1.1
subevent: Consideration of battery manufacturing with automotive and power sectors
event_id: ev1.1
description: The increasing intersection of battery manufacturing with the automotive and power sectors highlights efforts by the Bolivian state to integrate its resources into this network via a strategy of majority state control in alliance with external (German, Chinese) partners.

Subevent 1.2
subevent: Highlighting the organisation of battery production from mineral extraction through to end-uses in mobile and stationary energy storage and differing firm strategies along this chain
event_id: ev1.2
description: Existing applications to battery minerals adopt GPN as a loose heuristic â€“ a way of invoking the organisation and control of downstream production and its influence on extraction.
