Subevent 1.2
subevent: Hydrometallurgy
event_id: ev1.2
description: In hydrometallurgy, specialized solution reagents are primarily used to leach the targeted metals out from the cathode substance.

Subevent 1.3
subevent: Bioleaching
event_id: ev1.3
description: The bioleaching technique uses bacteria to retrieve precious metals, but it is challenging because the bacteria need a substantial amount of time to grow and are easily susceptible to contamination.
