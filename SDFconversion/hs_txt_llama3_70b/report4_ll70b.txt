Event 1
event: EU production and diversification of supply
event_id: ev1
description: Total battery consumption in the EU will almost reach 400 GWh in 2025 (and 4 times more in 2040), driven by use in e-mobility (about 60% of the total capacity in 2025, and 80% in 2040). The EU is expected to expand its production base for battery raw materials and components over 2022-2030, and improve its current position and global share. However, dependencies and bottlenecks in the supply chain will remain creating vulnerabilities.
