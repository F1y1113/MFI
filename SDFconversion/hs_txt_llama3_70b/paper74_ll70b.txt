Subevent 1.1
subevent: Pyrometallurgy
event_id: ev1.1
description: The battery is melted in a hot furnace to recover some of the cathode metal.

Subevent 1.2
subevent: Hydrometallurgy
event_id: ev1.2

Subevent 1.3
subevent: Bioleaching
event_id: ev1.3
description: The bioleaching technique uses bacteria to retrieve precious metals, but it is challenging because the bacteria need a substantial amount of time to grow and are easily susceptible to contamination.
participants: Bacteria ev1.3.1_P0.5, Precious Metals ev1.3.2_P0.25, Time ev1.3.3_P0.125
