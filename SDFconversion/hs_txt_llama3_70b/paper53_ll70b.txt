Event 1
event: Decarbonizing Electricity Production via Solar, Wind, and Lithium Supply
event_id: ev1
description: As electricity production decarbonizes via the deployment of solar, wind environment. The industry goal in the 2010s was to meet Chinese demand, not to have low CO2 intensity lithium supply.

Event 5
event: Using Bacteria for Retrieving Precious Metals in Lithium-Ion Recycling
event_id: ev5
description: The bioleaching technique uses bacteria to retrieve precious metals, but it is challenging because the bacteria need a substantial amount of time to grow and are easily susceptible to contamination.
