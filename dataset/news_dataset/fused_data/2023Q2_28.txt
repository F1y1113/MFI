Monday, June 26, 2023 – At least nine people were reportedly killed after Russian air strikes on rebel-held Idlib province, Syria. The United Nations expressed its concerns about the hostilities in the province.

Bombs dropped from warplanes killed nine people next to a market outside Jisr al-Shughour. Two other people were also killed in an air strike near Idlib city. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group has termed the attack the deadliest Russian attack this year.

Russia's military did not comment on the situation immediately. Their air campaign supporting the Syrian government has been crucial in turning the tide of the civil war that has been going on for 12 years. The strikes were said to be a retaliation for attacks that had killed civilians in government-held Hama and Latakia provinces.

Wednesday, May 10, 2023 — According to official media, at least 21 people have perished in wildfires in Russia's Ural highlands. Russia has witnessed a lot of forest fires in recent years, which experts attribute to arid summers and high temperatures.

In the past few days, wildfires raged in the Kurgan area of the Urals and in Siberia. According to local media, the majority of those killed were elderly persons who were unable to leave their houses. According to local officials, many of the deaths happened on Sunday in the village of Yuldus, in Kurgan province, on the border between the Urals and Siberia.

Regional emergency authorities warned that the death toll might rise. In Kurgan province, where over 5,000 structures have burnt down, a state of emergency has been declared. Fires have also consumed thousands of hectares in Sverdlovsk province and parts of Siberia's Omsk and Tyumen regions.
