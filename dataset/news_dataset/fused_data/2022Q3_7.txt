Monday, July 18, 2022 – Different places in the world have reported unprecedented levels of temperatures. 40C temperatures were reported in the U.K., the highest ever reported in the country’s history. 

Many people have fled from wildfires in France, Portugal, and Spain. Similar reports were given across North America. Smoke and soot blurred out the daylight in Argentina and Paraguay.

Experts have claimed that the vegetation around the world has become more flammable, and the soil is growing dry due to climate change. All of these factors increased the likelihood of wildfires occurring. Experts have advised that the governments of countries affected by the heatwave make plans to adapt to increasing temperatures as the years go by. 

Experts have shown that the Savannahs make up 70% of the world’s wildfires. The trend of fires, however, has been different in Africa. This is owing to changes in land usage, especially the rise of agricultural expansion. As it was reduced, it also led to an overall reduction of wildfires around the globe.

Friday, September 9, 2022 - Officials of Ukraine confirmed that the military had made a sweeping gain in a counteroffensive in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, which President Volodymyr Zelenskiy asserted that Ukrainian forces have reclaimed a vital city in the region and that Russian offensives across the country are being repelled.

Zelenskiy posted a video of Ukrainian soldiers on his social media accounts. In the video, the soldiers were standing above a building in the key Kharkiv city of Balakliia, held by the Russians for six months, alongside the Ukrainian flag.

Ukrainian troops have also reached the city of Kupyansk in the Kharkiv region. The city is a key logistics and supply hub for Russian forces. However, according to a photo that shows the Ukrainian soldiers holding a flag in front of a signpost at the southern entrance of the city, the city, which is roughly 70 miles east of Kharkiv, is yet to be retaken by the Ukrainian forces.

Friday, July 22, 2022 – The European Union expressed anger over MPs’ backing of legislation overriding the post-Brexit arrangement for Northern Ireland by launching four other legal cases against the government of the United Kingdom.

At the House of Commons, the protocol bill for Northern Ireland was cleared at its third hearing by 267 votes to 195 and will arrive at the Lords in the autumn.

The EU court possesses the power to impose multimillion-euro fines on the UK, and its decision could be the first step towards the bloc’s taking punitive action through mechanisms with Brexit deals. 

The commission made a statement on Friday that it was taking legal action partly in light of “the continued passage of the Northern Ireland protocol bill through the UK parliament,” which was said to “go directly against” the spirit of proffering collective solutions to current issues.

Automotive giant Ford is shoring up its battery supply chain — partly by importing lower-cost, iron-based batteries popular in China — as it sprints to increase electric vehicle production.

Why it matters: Employing cheaper, safer and more durable iron batteries could accelerate demand for mass-market electric vehicles (EVs), and help automakers sidestep nickel and cobalt supply problems that have been driving up EV prices.

The big picture: Carmakers' plans to shift away from gasoline-powered vehicles won't succeed unless they can secure reliable battery supplies. But with raw materials in short supply — and sourced primarily in Asia — the battery race is turning into a fierce geopolitical competition.

Driving the news: Ford said Thursday it had lined up enough batteries to meet its short-term goal of producing 600,000 EVs annually by 2023, up dramatically from the 27,140 battery-powered cars it sold in the U.S. last year.

The company, which is spending $50 billion to expand its EV lineup, also said it was 70% to its goal of securing enough batteries to produce 2 million EVs annually by 2026.
Ford announced a slew of supplier deals and partnerships — including contracts to buy raw materials directly from mining companies, as other automakers have done.
Details: One way Ford intends to meet its EV targets: adding a second type of battery chemistry to its lineup called lithium iron phosphate (LFP), alongside its existing nickel cobalt manganese (NCM) chemistry.

It will initially import LFP battery packs from China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd. (CATL) for its Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning pickup, starting next year.
But Ford also wants to produce LFP batteries in North America, and plans to open a 40-GWh LFP cell factory by 2026. (That's in addition to three previously announced battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky.)
Between the lines: Iron and phosphorous are abundant, which is why LFP cells cost at least 30% less than today's nickel- and cobalt-based batteries, Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Guidehouse Insights, explains in Forbes.

And they're less likely to catch fire because the chemistry is more stable.
Yes, but: LFP batteries pack 30% less energy than similarly-sized nickel-rich batteries, which translates into shorter driving range.

This isn't a huge issue in China because buyers there care more about price and durability than driving range.
But Americans, who aspire to take long road trips, want longer-range EVs capable of going 300 miles or more between charges.
Instead of installing a larger battery to meet their range expectations, carmakers can squeeze more LFP cells into battery packs by redesigning their module structure, per Abuelsamid.
What to watch: Tesla increasingly uses cobalt-free LFP batteries in its entry-level vehicles, and it's expected Ford and others will too.

Meanwhile, nickel-based batteries will be used for pricier performance cars.
What they're saying: "We know that the battery material cost is where the war will be won in the short term," said Lisa Drake, vice president of EV industrialization for Ford's Model e division.
