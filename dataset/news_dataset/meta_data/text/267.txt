Tuesday, May 30, 2023 – A blanket diplomatic immunity has been issued by South Africa to all leaders who will attend an August summit. This means that the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, might be able to make a trip to Johannesburg without the fear of the country acting on an international criminal court arrest warrant for him.

In August, South Africa will host a summit of Brics groups: Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South Africa. A planning meeting of foreign ministers is expected to take place on Thursday, which will last two days.

On Tuesday, the Department of Foreign Affairs backed the immunity, saying it is a standard conferment of immunities for all international conferences and summits held in South Africa. The department also added that “the immunities are for conferences and not for specific individuals.
