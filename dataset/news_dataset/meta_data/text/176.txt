Tuesday, November 1, 2022 â€“ The President of the United States, Joe Biden, has accused oil companies of "war profiteering" as the possibility of a windfall tax was raised if the companies do not boost domestic production.

While giving a remark, with just over a week left from the midterm election due to hold on November 8, President Biden criticized significant oil companies for making record profits while refusing the prices at the pump for the people of America. The President vowed to look to congress to levy tax penalties on oil companies if they don't invest toward lowering the cost of fuel for American citizens.

The President emphasized more on ExxonMobil, which reported an earning of $19.7bn last week in the third quarter alone. He accused the company of using its record profits to provide shareholders with hefty dividends but failed to invest in improving production that would benefit consumers at the pump.
