Friday, July 29, 2022 - Russia’s defense ministry made a statement that 40 Ukrainian war prisoners had been killed by Ukrainian shelling of a prison held by separatists in Donetsk, but Ukraine’s military denied carrying out such an operation and instead said it was Russia that shelled the prison. 

Ukraine’s General Staff said the Russian occupants pursued their goals to accuse Ukraine of committing ‘war crimes.’ He also said, “the Russian reports aim to hide the torture of prisoners and shootings committed there by the orders of the occupation administration and the command of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.” 

A spokesperson of the Russian-backed separatist Donetsk People’s Republic, Daniil Bezsonov, stated that the strike was a “direct hit on a barracks holding prisoners.” There might be an increase in the number of people killed. 

The Russian defense ministry also claimed that US-made Himars artillery was used to carry out the operation and accused Ukraine of a deliberately perpetrated provocation.
