Thursday, July 13, 2023 â€“ Overflowing water from the Yamuna River has hit an all-time high in almost 45 years and has swamped Delhi's major highways. Authorities have evacuated thousands of people and rerouted traffic from major thoroughfares. This monsoon season in Northern India has seen record rainfall, with 88 deaths in Himachal Pradesh and catastrophic flooding in Punjab and Haryana.

Authorities stated Yamuna's water level increased to 208.46 meters from 207.49 meters the previous day, the highest in 45 years. The rising river has swamped various low-lying regions and roadways. Social media videos show cars and buses immersed in water on the streets.

Heavy trucks, except those delivering critical services, cannot enter Delhi. The Delhi administration has relocated nearly 16,000 people to relief tents beneath flyovers. Disaster assistance teams have been sent to numerous places, and rescue attempts in flooded areas are ongoing.
