Tuesday, April 26, 2022 - Russia will cut natural gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria after the two nations refused to pay in rubles, dramatically escalating existing tensions with the West. PGNiG, Poland's state-run gas company said in a statement on Tuesday that Gazprom informed it on April 26 "of its decision to fully suspend deliveries under the Yamal contract at the beginning of the contract day on April 27."

PGNiG said it would suspend gas supplies along the Yamal pipeline starting Wednesday morning, and the news sent US natural gas futures up about 3% on Tuesday.
