Tuesday, August 30, 2022 â€“ In the southern part of China, Shenzhen shut down the most prominent electronic market in the world and had public transport suspended nearby as authorities enforced neighborhood-wide lockdowns in response to a small number of Covid cases.

According to the district government, Huaqianbei, a busy shopping area home to thousands of stalls selling computer components, mobile phones parts, and microchips, is among three neighborhoods placed under a mandatory four-day lockdown in the Futian district.

China is one of the places in the world still enforcing stringent zero-Covid measures. Except for supermarkets, pharmacies, and hospitals in the affected area, all businesses are shut down through Thursday. Restaurant dining is also suspended, with only takeaways allowed. 

Due to the heavy-handed approach, dozens of neighborhoods across Shenzhen have been identified as "high-risk areas" and placed under strict lockdown orders.
