Friday, March 31, 2023 — Finland is set to become the 31st member of NATO, after the Turkish parliament approved its application in a vote. Finland’s bid to join the West’s defensive alliance was delayed for months by Turkey, complaining that the country was supporting terrorists.

Finland’s admission into NATO will be made official at its next summit, which will take place in July, in Lithuania. The Secretary-General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Twitter that he “looks forward to raising Finland’s flag at NATO Headquarters in the coming days.” 

Earlier this month, the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip, approved Finland’s bid and praised the country’s authentic and concrete steps on Turkish security.

Finland will now become the seventh NATO country on the Baltic Sea, further isolating Russia’s coastal access at St. Petersburg.
