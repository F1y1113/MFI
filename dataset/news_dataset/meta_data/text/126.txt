Tuesday, August 16, 2022 - In the Sichuan province of China, all factories were forced to shut down for six days to ease a power shortage in the region due to a scorching heat wave that swept across the country.

Sichuan is one of the key manufacturing locations for the semiconductor and solar panel industries. Some of the world's biggest electronic companies would be affected by the current situation in China, including Apple supplier Foxconn and Intel.

With temperatures crossing 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), China is facing what appears to be its worst heat wave in 60 years. Due to extreme heat, there has been an increase in the demand for Air conditioning in offices and homes, which puts a lot of pressure on the power grid.

In a note to the client, Daiwa Capital analyst said that shutting down factories for the week could tighten the supply of polysilicon and lithium and push prices higher.
