Friday, August 19, 2022 - South Korea's offer of economic support to North Korea has been rejected. They made this offer in exchange for denuclearization. North Korea said the proposal suggests President Yoon Suk Yeol is "really simple," state media KCNA reported Friday.

A proposal to swap economic cooperation for an end to North Korea's nuclear program was first made by Yoon in May, during his inauguration speech.

Yoon's offer was rejected by Kim Yo Jong, the younger sister of Kim Jong Un. She further leveled attacks at Yoon. She said, "to think that the plan to barter 'economic cooperation' for our honor, nukes, is the great dream, hope, and plan of Yoon, and we come to realize that he is really simple." She also said North Korea would not be sitting face to face with South Korea.

The Unification Ministry in South Korea responded that North Korea has distorted South Korea's idea and stated its intention to continue nuclear development instead of responding to the bold initiative.
