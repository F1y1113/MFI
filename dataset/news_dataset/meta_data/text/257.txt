Thursday, April 27, 2023 – A team of international climate scientists with the World Weather Attribution (WWA) made recent comments concerning the elongated drought in the Horn of Africa, noting that the rising greenhouse gas emissions made the drought at least 100 times more likely.

It is much more difficult to specifically mark the cause of droughts, unlike heatwaves and heavy rainfall, because of the complex processes that cause drought; however, the WWA team was able to show that climate change has rendered the Horn of Africa's long rains from March to May twice as likely, and the short rains from October to December wetter, using computer models and climatic measurements.

According to an analysis released on Thursday, the drought that has left 4.35 million people in the Horn of Africa in desperate need of humanitarian help – with 43,000 believed to have perished in Somalia last year – would not have been feasible without climate change. Since October 2020, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia have seen five failed consecutive wet seasons.
