Thursday, September 28, 2023 – According to scientists, the continual combustion of fossil fuels is causing climate breakdown, in just two years, the volume of Swiss glaciers has decreased by 10%. The continual loss of the ice can be traced to abnormally hot summers and winters with very little snowfall. 

The volume lost in the 2022 and 2023 scorching summers is equal to the volume lost in the 1960s to 1990s. This year's record temperature was witnessed in the Swiss Alps. The Swiss weather service discovered that in August, the month of maximum melting, the elevation at which precipitation freezes set a new record overnight high—5,289 meters.

The melting ice is changing the mountainous scene. This meant that the minor glaciers had melted away and the large glaciers would continue to shrink. The Swiss Academy of Sciences discovered that 4% of Switzerland's total glacier volume was lost this year, the second-largest annual drop on record. The greatest dip occurred in 2022, when it was 6%.
