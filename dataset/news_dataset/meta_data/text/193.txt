Thursday, December 8, 2022 â€“ According to one study, the fetuses of women working in fields in the Gambia showed concerning increases in heart rates and decreases in blood flow to the placenta as temperatures rose.

Hundreds of millions of people, including mothers, are expected to be exposed to extreme heat worldwide, even if global temperatures remain below the internationally agreed-upon limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

The study may help to understand why expecting moms suffer from heat stress. Two possible explanations are sweat, which causes dehydration, and diverting blood and oxygen from the placenta to the mother's skin to cool the body.

The researchers also discovered that increasing a measure of heat stress by 1 degree Celsius increased the risk of fetal distress by 17%. Even after accounting for the rise in the woman's temperature and heart rate, it increased by 12%, indicating that other factors were affecting the fetus.
