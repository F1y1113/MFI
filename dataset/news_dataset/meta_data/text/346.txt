Thursday, October 12, 2023 â€“ The University of New South Wales and the Bureau of Meteorology examined patterns between 1979 and 2021 and discovered that hail-prone circumstances have increased significantly over Australia's south-east and south-west. The research gives a clear picture of how climate continues to change in Australia.

Updrafts, moisture in the air, and cold enough temperatures up in the atmosphere combine to generate hailstones. Another critical factor is Wind shear which is defined as variations in horizontal wind direction or speed at various heights in the atmosphere.

The economic significance of these studies is enormous. According to the Insurance Council of Australia, the expenses of the 1999 Sydney hailstorm would equal an estimated $8.85 billion in insured damages if it occurred in 2023, far outweighing the costs of the severe 2022 floods in south-east Queensland and New South Wales.
