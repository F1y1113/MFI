Friday, December 9, 2022 – The government of the United Kingdom approved its first coal mining operation in the last 30 years, a project which critics have dubbed “disastrous” to the UK climate change targets. Initially approved by the in October 2020 and backed by 40 conservative MPs, the coal mining operation is targeted at manufacturing steel, not electricity generation.

The UK especially needed the coal mine as they could not depend on Russia to import coal since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This made experts warn that the development would prevent the UK from meeting its goal of reducing the emission of greenhouse gases by 2035 by 78%. 

According to the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), If the UK does not drop the use of coal by 2035, it will result in the need for expensive capture and disposal methods of the emitted gases.
