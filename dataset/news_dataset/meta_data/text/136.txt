Friday, September 9, 2022 - Officials of Ukraine confirmed that the military had made a sweeping gain in a counteroffensive in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, which President Volodymyr Zelenskiy asserted that Ukrainian forces have reclaimed a vital city in the region and that Russian offensives across the country are being repelled.

Zelenskiy posted a video of Ukrainian soldiers on his social media accounts. In the video, the soldiers were standing above a building in the key Kharkiv city of Balakliia, held by the Russians for six months, alongside the Ukrainian flag.

Ukrainian troops have also reached the city of Kupyansk in the Kharkiv region. The city is a key logistics and supply hub for Russian forces. However, according to a photo that shows the Ukrainian soldiers holding a flag in front of a signpost at the southern entrance of the city, the city, which is roughly 70 miles east of Kharkiv, is yet to be retaken by the Ukrainian forces.
