Saturday, February 18, 2023 — After Kyiv's warning that its forces need more supplies, officials confirm that the European Union is exploring ways for its member countries to come together and buy munitions to assist Ukraine. The EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss getting a 155-millimeter artillery on Monday at a meeting in Brussels.

On Saturday, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission President, said, “it is now time to really speed up the production and also to scale up the production of standardized products that Ukraine desperately needs.” She also said the purchase could be similar to the EU’s advance purchase of COVID vaccines.

Minister for Foreign Affairs in Ukraine, Dmytro Kuleba, described the need for ammunition as a critical issue, which he had discussed with the defense industry leaders at the Munich conference.
