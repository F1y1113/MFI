Wednesday, July 12, 2023 â€“ Japan and South Korea officials confirmed North Korea had fired a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The long-range missile flew for over one hour just before landing in Japanese water on Wednesday morning. In response to the missile, the United States and South Korea have increased their joint military drill around the peninsula.

North Korea fired the missile shortly after threatening retaliation against the United States for the recent spy plane incursion over its territory. However, the accusations were dismissed by Washington, saying its military patrols are in line with international law.

The President of South Korea, Yoon Suk-Yeol, convened an emergency meeting of his national security council. He convened the meeting in Lithuania, where he is attending the NATO summit.
