Wednesday, June 15, 2022 - Russia is now the world’s most sanctioned country, with over 10,500 restrictions imposed on Russian individuals and businesses, 7,500 of which were implemented in the last four months.

The effect of the sanctions can be seen in their newly manufactured cars which lack many security technologies that would have otherwise been imported from other countries. It can be seen in their malls which now have reduced traffic and reduced choice of products.

China, Russia’s most prominent ally yet in the past four months, has stated that it will not supply Russia with sanctioned technology due to fear of secondary Sanctions. 

For Russia, sanctions are not new. The trends have ramped up since 2014. In addition, Russia is making huge gains as never before from oil. The revenue can fund its military and prevent a spike in local unemployment.
