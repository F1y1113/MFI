Saturday, August 19, 2023 â€“ Officials from Ukraine confirm that a Russian missile strike has killed at least seven people and injured close to 130 others. One of the seven people who were killed was a six-year-old girl. The missile from Russia hit a university and a theater, where a drone manufacturing event occurred.

The president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky said that a regular Saturday was turned into a painful one due to the attack. The acting mayor of Chernihiv city, Oleksandr Lomako, said the attack happened in the middle of the day when many people were in the city center. He also said the attack can only be interpreted as a war crime against civilians.

One of the organizers of the events said the local military-civilian administration approved the drone event, and the authorities also approved the venue.
