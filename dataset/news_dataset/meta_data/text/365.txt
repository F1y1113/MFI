Thursday, December 21, 2023 â€“ For weeks, Iceland has been bracing for volcanic activity. Since late October, the region surrounding Reykjavik has seen a spike in earthquake activity. On Monday, a volcanic eruption broke out on the Reykjanes peninsula of south-west Iceland, after weeks of threatened earthquake activity.

By Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, the fumes had reached Reykjavik. Last month, some 4,000 people were evacuated from Grindavik, a fishing village threatened by the lava flow.

Volcanologist Dr Evgenia Ilyinskaya in her expert opinion said, there would not be the same level of disruption as the similar eruption from 2010, as these volcanoes in south-west Iceland were "physically not able to generate the same ash clouds"; nevertheless, the local people had been both fearful and expectant of the volcano to erupt.

Images and videos circulated on social media demonstrate lava erupting from the volcano only an hour after an earthquake swarm was discovered, but the Icelandic foreign minister assured that the event would not disrupt flight plans and activities within the country.
