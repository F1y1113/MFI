Saturday, October 22, 2022 - The Minister for Defense of the United States held rare telephone talks with his Russian counterpart after a pro-kremlin official made it known that they were turning Ukraine's Southern city of Kherson into a "fortress" as Kyiv's forces advance.

There were few details of the conversation between Russia's Sergei Shoigu and US defense secretary Lloyd Austin but confirmed to have discussed Ukraine. However, Russia's defense ministry said Topical international security issues, including the situation in Ukraine, were discussed.

No specifics were given by the Pentagon other than saying that Austin, who initiated the conversation, emphasized a need for lines of communication amid the war in Ukraine.

A senior security negotiator, Gavrilov, also said that in the wake of the call, Moscow expected clarification about the nuclear deterrence exercise that NATO is carrying out.
