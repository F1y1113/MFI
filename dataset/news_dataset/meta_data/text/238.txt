Saturday, March 25, 2023 — The ministry of foreign affairs in Honduras announced on Saturday that the country is formally ending its diplomatic ties with Taiwan. 

In the statement, the ministry said, “the government of the Republic of Honduras recognizes the existence of one China in the world and that the government of the People’s Republic of China represents China as a whole.” The ministry also added that it recognizes Taiwan as part of China and ends the diplomatic tie with Taiwan.

China will not maintain diplomatic ties with any country that recognizes Taiwan. They have spent much of the last 40 years trying to isolate the self-ruled island by taking away its diplomatic allies with offers of economic support. Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, China has mounted military, diplomatic, and economic pressure on Taiwan.
