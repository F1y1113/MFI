Monday, February 20, 2023 — The president of the United States, Joe Biden, paid a surprise visit to Kyiv on Monday, which makes it the first time he has been to the country since the invasion of Russia almost a year ago.

Biden announced a new $500 million assistance for Ukraine, saying the package would include more military equipment, such as artillery ammunition, more javelins, and Howitzers. He also announced that new sanctions would be imposed on Moscow later in the week.

Biden’s visitation in person shows a sign of American support for President Zelensky. After a very long journey from Washington, Biden got to Kyiv at 8 a.m. local time and arrived at the Mariinsky Palace 30 minutes later. President Zelensky shook his hand as he was about to depart in the afternoon and said, “thank you for coming.”
