Tuesday, March 14, 2023 – A United States drone has crashed into the black sea following an encounter with a Russian fighter jet. The United States military confirmed that the fighter jet damaged the propeller of the American MQ-9 Reaper drone.

Commander of the U.S. Air Force Europe and Air Force Africa, Air Force Gen. James B. Hecker, said in a statement that the “MQ-9 aircraft was conducting routine operations in international airspace when it was intercepted and hit by a Russian aircraft, which resulted in a crash and complete loss of the MQ-9.”

Anatoly Antonov, the Ambassador of Russia to the United States after he was summoned to the State Department following the drone incident, said Russia does not want any confrontation with the United States.

The National Security Council communications coordinator said he is unsure whether or not the U.S. will recover the drone.
