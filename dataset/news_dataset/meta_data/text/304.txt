Tuesday, August 8, 2023 – Italy has imposed a one-off windfall tax on local banks accused of reaping billions in extra profit from rising interest rates. The government approved the tax in a cabinet meeting and planned to use the proceeds to support mortgage holders and cut taxes when rising rates have put extra pressure on households.

The deputy prime minister of Italy, Matteo Salvini, said one only has to concentrate on banks’ profits in the first half of 2023 and the result of the European Central Bank’s rate hikes.  The government plans to tax 40% of this income stream, with the payment due by the middle of 2024.

An equity analyst such as Jefferies said that the decision by the Italian government to tax the net interest margin came unexpectedly. Jefferies estimates that up to €4.9 billion will be paid by Italy's 10 largest publicly listed banks.
