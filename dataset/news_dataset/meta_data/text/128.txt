Sunday, August 21, 2022 â€“ A close ally of Vladimir Putin lost his daughter in a suspected car bombing. Russia's investigative committee confirmed that Darya Dugina, 29, died after an explosion on a road outside Moscow.

Her father, Alexander Dugin, known as "Putin's brain," is thought to have been the attack's intended target. Mr. Dugin is a prominent ultra-nationalist ideologue who is believed to have a close relationship with the Russian President. 

An explosive device is said to have been planted under the car, it went off, and the vehicle caught fire. Forensic and explosive experts are still carrying out investigations.

Ukrainian official has dismissed accusations of Ukraine being involved in the incident. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, said, "Ukraine has nothing to do with this because we are not a criminal state."
