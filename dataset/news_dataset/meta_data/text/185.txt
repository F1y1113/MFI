Thursday, November 10, 2022 â€“ According to a comprehensive analysis, carbon emissions from fossil fuels will reach new highs this year. The researchers said there is no sign of the needed decline, putting additional pressure on the countries whose representatives are meeting in Egypt for the UN Cop27 climate summit to deliver real and swift action. 

Continued emissions at this rate would make 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming more likely in the coming decade, according to the researchers. To achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as many countries have pledged, an annual reduction comparable to the sharp drop in 2020 due to Covid-19 lockdowns is now required.

According to the analysis, coal emissions will return to their all-time high in 2014. However, unlike in the past, this is being driven by India and the European Union rather than China.
