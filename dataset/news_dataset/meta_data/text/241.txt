Wednesday, March 8, 2023 â€“ According to a study in the "Nature" journal, the smoke from the Australian bushfires in 2019 and 2020 briefly reduced the ozone layer's thickness by 3% to 5% in 2020. Recent research showed that particles in wildfire smoke could trigger chemicals that damage the ozone layer, which raises the possibility that future ozone recovery may be slowed down by more intense and frequent fires.

The lead researcher, Prof Susan Solomon, an atmospheric scientist at MIT in the U.S., said the ozone breakdown by smoke particles was comparable to the Antarctic ozone hole emerging each spring, "but at much warmer temperatures."

The researchers also noted that although the ozone hole often forms over Antarctica due to the region's freezing temperatures, Wildfire aerosols appear capable of boosting ozone losses.
