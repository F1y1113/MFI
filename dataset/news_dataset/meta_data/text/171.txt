Sunday, October 23, 2022 - The president of China, Xi Jinping, revealed a new leadership team stacked with loyal allies and has formally stepped into his norm-breaking third term ruling China with a tight grip on power.

After a close of the five-yearly Communist Party Congress on Sunday, Xi announced six men; Li Qiang, Zhao Leji, Wang Huning, Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, and Li Xi, to stand with him as members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the top ruling body in China.

With the lineup filled with core Xi loyalists, it made it clear that Xi had not only broken with recent precedent to take on a third term at the party's helm but also had the power concentrated at the very top to an extent unseen in decades.

Also, the full lineup of the 24-member Politburo was revealed Xi, which for the first time in at least 25 years, includes no women, highlighting the minimal level of female representation in the Party's top echelons.
