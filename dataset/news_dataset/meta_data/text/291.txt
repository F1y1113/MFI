Saturday, July 15, 2023 – South Korean President Yoon Suk-Yeol has promised to increase his country's humanitarian and non-lethal military assistance to Ukraine. This decision comes after a summit with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Being the world’s ninth-largest arms exporter, South Korea has a longstanding policy not to supply lethal weapons to an active conflict zone.

President Yoon and his wife, Kim Keon-Hee, traveled to Ukraine after visiting Lithuania for a NATO summit. It is the first visit Yoon has made to Ukraine since Russia invaded the country almost 17 months ago. The humanitarian aid would also be increased to $150m in 2023.

During a joint briefing, President Zelenskiy appreciated the South Korean President's encouraging words and firm support. He also praised the transfer of vehicles and demining equipment to Ukraine.
