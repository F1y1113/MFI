Friday, June 9, 2023 – Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the United States and Saudi Arabia had announced a ceasefire between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces. The ceasefire is expected to start on Saturday and last for 24 hours.

The statement said, “Saudi and the US join the people of Sudan in their frustration over the non-commitment of the previous truces.” The statement also said that the two warring factions had agreed to allow the movement of humanitarian aid all across Sudan.

The foreign ministry of Sudan, which backs the armed forces of the country, on Thursday, notified the United Nations that the special representative of the United Nation’s Secretary-General in Sudan, Volker Perthes, had been declared “persona non grata.”
