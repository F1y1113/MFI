Tuesday, October 4, 2022 – On the Dnieper River, northeast of Kherson, Ukrainian forces have broken through the Russian position, a strategic city in southern Ukraine that is held by Russia. The Russian military and Russian-installed officials in the region reported the advancement. They termed it as a heavy defensive fire.

During his evening speech, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the fierce fighting continues in many areas, but he gave no further details.

In the south, the Russian-installed leader in Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, said Ukraine troops had broken through Dudchany, a town on the Dnieper that is about 30km (20miles) south of the previous frontline.

Mr. Saldo also added that “there are some settlements that are occupied by Ukrainian troops. Some Russian reports say Dudchany has been completely retaken by Ukraine.
