Monday, May 23, 2022 – Boris Bondarev, a counselor at the Russian permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva, resigned from his diplomat position.

Since the war broke out in February, the 20-year veteran has been the only high-level diplomat yet to resign from the Russian foreign ministry. He is the counselor on arms control at the Russian diplomatic mission in Geneva.

He termed the war an aggressive move by Putin that is all about “lies, warmongering, and hatred.” He further emphasized that other diplomats feel the same way about the situation but are unlikely to speak out.

Hillel Neuer, the executive director of the Geneva-based human rights organization UN Watch has commended Bodnarev and urged other diplomats to follow his example.

Bodnarev was asked about a possible return back to Russia following his resignation. He said, “that would not be a very good idea right now.”
