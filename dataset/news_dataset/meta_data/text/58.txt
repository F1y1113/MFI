Monday, May 16, 2022 - Amongst the several policies of former President Trump that President Biden has reversed is the withdrawal of US troops from Somalia.

Trump ordered a withdrawal in early 2020 as part of efforts to reduce US involvement in international politics. However, Biden has approved the redeployment of fewer than 500 troops back to the East African country to restore the US military presence in consultation with the Somali government.

According to the Pentagon official, the withdrawal was “abrupt and sudden,” giving strength and morale to the al-Shabaab forces. President Biden believes that al-Shabaab poses a notable threat and that the presence of US troops will contain the group. No confirmation has been made to suggest targeted strikes on specific leaders of al-Shabaab. Still, more emphasis has been made on other non-military components of the US counter-terrorism strategy in Somalia.
