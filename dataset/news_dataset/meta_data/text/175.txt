Wednesday, October 26, 2022 â€“ The World Meteorological Organization discovered the largest year-on-year increase in methane concentrations in 2020 and 2021 since systematic observations began over 40 years ago.

Scientists are perplexed by the recent dramatic spike in methane levels. Some blamed it on increased fracking in the United States, although this was called into question because industrial emissions did not grow as sharply.

According to World Meteorological Organization research, atmospheric levels of all three greenhouse gases have hit record highs, indicating that the world is "going in the wrong direction."  These greenhouse gases are responsible for global warming, with the impact increasing by 50% between 1990 and 2021. Carbon dioxide accounted for almost 80% of this growth. 

These data will be released at the Cop27 UN climate summit in November when global leaders will gather in Egypt to reach agreements on greenhouse gas emissions reductions.
