Friday, January 6, 2023 – Not less than 24 people were killed when the Mexican authorities tried to apprehend the son of Mexican drug kingpin “El Chapo.” Ovidio Guzman-Lopez, son of El Chapo and 32 years old and the leader of the father’s former cartel, was flown to Mexico City after being captured in Culiacan.

10 military officers and 19 suspects were killed during his arrest. The Minister for Défense, Luis Cresencio Sandoval, said 35 other military officers we wounded and 21 suspects we also arrested.

Mr. Sandoval said the United States was part of the six-month surveillance operation to capture Mr. Guzman-Lopez. The operation sparked a lot of violence from the cartel members, from burning vehicles to hitting at least 2 planes with gunfire.

A Mexico federal Judge, however, blocked any extradition process against him.
