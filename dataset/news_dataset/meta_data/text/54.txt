Wednesday, May 4, 2022 - Ukrainian refugees stuck within the Azovstal steel and iron plant in Mariupol recount horror stories when they were finally able to escape the steelwork’s tunnels and underground areas. After over 100 evacuees had to take cover with Ukrainian forces when the Russians moved forward and forced locals into hiding within the plant, this makeshift bunker was running out of food and water, and its stability was being questioned as the bombs rained down.

Babies, children, and dogs were included in the numbers trapped there, with mothers, fathers, and family members hunkering down and fearing the worst. However, this group of evacuees have been rescued and welcomed back onto Ukrainian-held soil in Zaporizhzhia, with reports that many believed “…we wouldn’t get out of there.”
