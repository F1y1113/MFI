Tuesday, August 23, 2022 - The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Tuesday vowed that Ukraine would recapture its annexed peninsula of Crimea from Russia when it chooses and that Kyiv will not make a consultation with other countries before it does.

Zelenskiy made the comments at a news conference in Kyiv after mass participation by country leaders and international organizations, most of them by video on the Crimea platform, a forum hosted by Ukraine focused on the peninsula.

Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 before a full-scale invasion was launched in February 2022, seizing chunks of Ukraine's Southern Kherson and regions of Zaporizhzhia.

In Zelenskiy's comment on Tuesday, he addressed the crisis at the Russian-held nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia that has been hit by shelling in recent weeks, calling for a mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency to the site.
