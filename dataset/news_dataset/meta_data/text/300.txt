Sunday, July 30, 2023 â€“ A political convention organized by an Islamist party in northwestern Pakistan was attacked by a suicide bomber, killing not less than 54 people. Over 100 people were injured in the attack targeted at the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazi (JUI-F) party members.

No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but the local branch of ISIS has previously targeted JUI-F party leaders who are considered apostates. Maulana Fazlur, the leader of the JUI-F party, has expressed deep sorrow and regret over the blast. A witness confirmed that over 500 people were at the convention when the blast occurred.

The incident was condemned by the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Shehbaz Sharif. An investigation has been launched concerning the blast, and the office of the Prime Minister has requested a report from the Minister for Interior, Arabs Sanaullah, and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government.
