Monday, July 17, 2023 – Russia has confirmed that it will not renew the grain deal with Ukraine when it expires, as it accuses the West of not holding up its side of the bargain. However, Russia confirmed they would return to the agreement if their conditions were met. The President of Russia had complained that part of the deal which would allow the export of Russian food had not been honoured.

The agreement brokered by the United Nations and Turkey in July 2022 is set to expire at 5 p.m. ET on Monday.

Secretary of State of the United States, Antony Blinken, had accused Russia of Using the grain deal as a weapon. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister, said, “Russia has been killing the grain initiative from one extension to another.” He also added that grain prices will increase worldwide with Russia ending the deal.
