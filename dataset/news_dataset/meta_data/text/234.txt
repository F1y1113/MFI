Saturday, March 18, 2023 â€” Despite the ongoing conflict with Russia, Ukraine has signed a deal enabling them to export millions of tons of grains through the Black Sea. However, it is unclear how long the deal will last, as Ukraine is pushing for 120 days, while Russia wants 60 days.

Ukraine is one of the top producers of grain in the world. But has since been denied access to ports in the Black Sea as Russian warships blocked it since the beginning of the conflict. Hours before the deal expires, the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip, announced the deal's extension on Saturday.

The Ambassador of Russia to the United Nations said on Friday that if the deal is to continue, the EU, U.S., and U.K. should remove any sanctions targeted at the agricultural sector in Russia within two months.
