Wednesday, May 10, 2023 â€” According to official media, at least 21 people have perished in wildfires in Russia's Ural highlands. Russia has witnessed a lot of forest fires in recent years, which experts attribute to arid summers and high temperatures.

In the past few days, wildfires raged in the Kurgan area of the Urals and in Siberia. According to local media, the majority of those killed were elderly persons who were unable to leave their houses. According to local officials, many of the deaths happened on Sunday in the village of Yuldus, in Kurgan province, on the border between the Urals and Siberia.
