Saturday, November 5, 2022 – As Seoul and Washington ended a high-profile six-day military exercise, South Korea’s military on Saturday confirmed that four short-range ballistic missiles had been fired by North Korea into the western sea.

A Series of missiles have been launched by North Korea this week, which includes a possible failed intercontinental ballistic missile, which drew condemnation from South Korea, Japan, and the United State and also raises speculation that it could be preparing to resume nuclear weapons testing for the first time since 2017.

The launches on Saturday, between 11:31 and 11:59 a.m., happened as South Korea and the United State finished the exercise known as “Vigilant Storm,” which they began on Monday. Seoul confirmed that the missiles flew about 80 miles, reaching an altitude of about 10 miles.
