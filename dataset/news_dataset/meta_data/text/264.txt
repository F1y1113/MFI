Monday, May 22, 2023 – The biggest oil refinery ever built in Africa opened in Nigeria, which plans to alleviate chronic fuel shortage. Nigeria, which is a major oil producer, has most of it sent abroad while having to import refined fuel used in vehicles and elsewhere.

Although the plant is not operational, it can produce 650,000 barrels of petroleum products daily. The refinery also includes a power station, deep seaport, and fertilizer plant. Building the plant was $19bn (£15.2bn). 

During the launch on Monday, the owner of the refinery, Mr. Aliko Dangote, who is the richest man in Africa, said the first goal of the refinery is to ramp up production of the various products to ensure that they can satisfy the need of the country this year.
