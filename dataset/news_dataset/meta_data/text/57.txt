Thursday, May 12, 2022 - The War between Russia and Ukraine has raised many security concerns worldwide, especially in countries that border the two countries. Finland Shares about 800 miles of border with Russia. It has never been a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member to avoid rows with Russia.

However, things are beginning to change with the Prime minister and President of Finland releasing a joint statement to join NATO. The formal announcement is expected to be made in a few days after thorough consultation by the parliament and respected political figures.

Sweden has also hinted at making similar decisions as soon as possible.

There have been different reactions from Russia and NATO members, with Russia threatening measures against the two countries if they violate their longstanding neutrality. On the other hand, NATO has a positive outlook on the announcement.
