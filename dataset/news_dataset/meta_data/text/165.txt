Saturday, October 15, 2022 - The military officials, political parties, and civil society leaders of Burkina Faso officially designated army captain Ibrahim Traore as the country's transitional President two weeks after he staged the second coup in Burkina Faso this year to seize power.

About 300 officials are meeting over two days in the capital, Ouagadougou, to lay out plans to return the West African country to constitutional rule.

Burkina Faso has been battling a violent insurgency waged by groups linked to Al Qaeda and Islamic State that started in neighboring Mali in 2012 and has since then spread to other countries South of the Sahara Desert. Thousands have been killed due to the violence, which displaced nearly two million and fueled political instability.

Traore has committed himself to democratic transition timeliness agreed between his predecessor, Paul-Henri Damiba, and the Economic Community of West African State (ECOWAS) to have constitutional order restored by July 2024
