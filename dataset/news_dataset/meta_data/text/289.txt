Monday, July 10, 2023 â€“ Major developments on the eve of NATO submission as the chief of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, announced that Turkey had agreed to back Sweden in their bid to join the military alliance.

Earlier on Monday, the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had said that Sweden could only join the alliance after his country is accepted into the European Union. Turkey has been the only country that stood apart from Sweden from joining NATO for over a year.

When asked when Sweden would be officially announced as a member of NATO, Stoltenberg said that it was up to Turkey to make an announcement. Erdogan has agreed to move to send the accession protocol for Sweden to the Grand National Assembly as soon as possible.
