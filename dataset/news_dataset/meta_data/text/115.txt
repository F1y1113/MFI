Saturday, July 23, 2022 – The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, met with a senior United States Congressional delegation in Kyiv and promised continued support in the war against Russia. 

The delegation, which included Adam Smith, chair of the House Armed Services Committee, stated, “The United States, along with allies and partners around the world, has stood with Ukraine by providing economic, military, and humanitarian assistance.” 

To make the total provided so far to 16, the United State Secretary of defense, Lloyd Washington, said on Wednesday that he would send four additional high mobility artillery rocket systems to Ukraine.

On Saturday, the statement made by the delegation made no specific reference to the transfer of weapons. Separately, Smith was quoted as telling the United States-backed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that additional launch rocket systems were ready to be provided by Washington and its allies.
