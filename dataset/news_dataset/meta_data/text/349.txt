Saturday, November 4, 2023 – The Palestinian Red Crescent has confirmed that an Israeli strike in an ambulance outside Gaza City’s biggest capital killed not less than 15 people. The attack was confirmed by Israel, saying that the ambulance was being used by Hamas operatives.

According to the statement from the Hamas government, it said the Israeli forces targeted “a convoy of ambulances which was transporting the wounded” from Al-Shifa Hospital Gaza City towards Rafah in the south. The Palestinian Red Crescent confirmed that the convoy was struck twice on its way to Al-Shifa Hospital. The first strike was 1km away and the second strike was outside the hospital gate.

The Ministry of Health in Egypt said that only 17 Palestinians who were wounded were evacuated for treatment in an Egyptian hospital, instead of the 28 that was originally planned.
