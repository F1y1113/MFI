Friday, August 18, 2023 â€“ The foreign ministry of Russia has confirmed that Russia has banned 54 British nationals and people who work for organizations in the United Kingdom from entering the country. The decision was taken in retaliation to the sanctions on Russian citizens by the government of the United Kingdom.

Russian government sanctioned the cultural secretary, Lucy Frazer; they accuse her of actively lobbying for the international sports isolation of Russia. Some of those who were sanctioned were the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, and the minister of State for Defense, Annabel Goldie.

The United Kingdom is among the Western countries to sanction Russia in response to its war with Ukraine in 2022. Over 1,000 businesses and individuals have been sanctioned by the U.S., EU, U.K., and other countries.
