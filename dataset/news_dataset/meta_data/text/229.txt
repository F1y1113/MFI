Friday, March 10, 2023 – The President of China, Xi Jinping, had his unprecedented third term as the President of China officially endorsed on Friday by the political elites in the country. The endorsement makes Xi the longest-serving president of Communist China since its founding in 1949.

The reappointment of Xi as President came on Friday by the legislature in a ceremonial vote in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People. After the voting process, he received a unanimous vote of 2,952 and a standing ovation.

69 years old Xi Jinping secured his position as the head of the communist party last fall, which makes his reappointment in Beijing seem like a formality. The real power in China lies in the positions of head of the party and military, respectively, two vital roles which Xi holds.
