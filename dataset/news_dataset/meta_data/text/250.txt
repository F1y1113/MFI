Battery maker Verkor will be supplying lithium batteries for the Alpine pure electric C-Crossover GT from its gigafactory in France from 2025

Since Renault made its investment in Verkor the two companies have worked together at the Verkor Innovation Centre (VIC) in Grenoble to approve the technical quality and commercial production process of the battery products Verkor will be supplying from the Dunkirk gigafactory.
