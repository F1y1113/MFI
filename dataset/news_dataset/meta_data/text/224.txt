Sunday. February 5, 2023 – Over the past few days, there have been reports of dozens of wildfires raging across central Chile, killing at least 23 people, destroying 800 homes, and prompting the declaration of an emergency in three regions. Sixty-six people have been injured in the fires, and nearly 1,500 others have sought refuge in shelters.

Three sparsely populated central regions have declared a state of emergency, home to many grape, apple, and berry farms and large tracts of forest land.

Carolina Tohá, Chile's interior minister, stated, "The flames should serve as yet another reminder of the consequences of the climate catastrophe. The development of climate change has repeatedly demonstrated its importance and potential to have a significant influence, which we must internalize much more."

Spain, the United States, Ecuador, Brazil, and Venezuela have all offered assistance, including aircraft and firemen, while Argentina is sending 64 firefighters, a forest fire pump truck, and a Chinook helicopter.
