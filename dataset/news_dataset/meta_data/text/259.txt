Sunday, May 7, 2023 — A spokesperson of the Arab League said that the foreign ministers of the Arab League had adopted a decision to have Syria readmitted into the league after more than a decade of suspension. The membership of Syria in the Arab League was suspended in 2011.

The decision, it means Syria could resume its participation in Arab League meetings with immediate effect. They also called for a resolution of the crisis resulting from Syria’s civil war, which includes the flight of refugees to neighboring countries and drug smuggling across the region.

According to the decision on Sunday, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, and the Secretary General of the Arab League would form a ministerial contact group to liaise with the Syrian government and seek a steady solution to the crisis.
