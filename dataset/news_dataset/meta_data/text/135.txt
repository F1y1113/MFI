Wednesday, September 7, 2022 - Wednesday, Russia's Envoy to Beijing, Andrey Desinov, told reporters that Chinese leader Xi Jinping and President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, will meet on the sidelines of a summit in Uzbekistan next week.

The expected meeting at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit would be the first time the two leaders who have established a close relationship will meet face-to-face since Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year.

Since the early days of the pandemic, the expected trip would be Xi's first oversea trip and comes just weeks before a major political meeting in Beijing, where he is expected to break tradition and assume a third term in power.

The scheduled meeting between Xi and Putin and the choice of destination for the first overseas trip Xi is taking signals the importance of the Russia relationship for China, even in the face of international blowback against Moscow since the war with Ukraine.
