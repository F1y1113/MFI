Friday, December 16, 2022 - The most recent wave of Russian strikes targeted at energy stations across Ukraine caused a blackout for hours in the second city of Kharkiv. Local officials confirmed that mine power facilities were hit due to the 76 missiles fired by Russia and the drone attacks on Friday.

Head of Kharkiv regional administration, Oleg Synegubov, later in the evening confirmed that electricity supplies had been restored to 55% of city residents and 85% of the residents in the northeastern region.

Yuriy Sak, the Defense Ministry adviser, said that even though the situation is still difficult, emergency services were working hard to restore the electricity supply. He said repairing the damages is getting more difficult due to frequent attacks from Russia.

Commander-in-Chief General Valeriy Zaluzhny said air defenses intercepted 60 of the 76 missiles fired by Russia. Most of the missiles were said to be cruise missiles.
