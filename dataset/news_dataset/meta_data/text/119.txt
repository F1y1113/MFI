Sunday, July 3, 2022 – Thousands of people in low-lying areas around Sydney were forced to leave their homes as a result of the third severe flooding storm to hit the region since March. The storms, according to experts, were due to the “dangers on several fronts.”

As severe downpour battered vast regions of the State, the State Emergency Service responded to more than 1,400 help requests in 24 hours and performed 29 water rescues.

The Hawkesbury-Nepean River breached substantial flood levels earlier than expected at 10.15 on Saturday night. At the same time, the Warragamba Dam spilled “well ahead” of predictions at 2 am on Sunday.

Hopes that the rain would reduce in the coming days were further dashed as the storm is expected to linger until Tuesday. According to experts, “far more heavy rain, forceful, damaging gusts, and shoreline erosion” should also be expected.
