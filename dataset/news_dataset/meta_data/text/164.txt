Saturday, October 8, 2022 – A huge explosion severely damaged the only bridge that connects the annexed Crimean Peninsula with the Russian mainland, crippling a supply route for the Russian war efforts in Ukraine.

From the images and the video shown from the scene, a part of the roadway on the Kerch Strait road-and-rail bridge, opened by President Putin himself in 2018, collapsed due to the blast.

There is yet to be confirmation of exactly what caused the blast at Europe’s longest bridge. Officials of Russia said a truck exploded, causing Crimea-bound sections of the bridge’s roadway to fall. A subsequent fire engulfed a train of fuel tanks on a separate, adjacent rail portion of the bridge. 

Russian state media reported that Putin ordered a “government commission” to examine the Kerch bridge immediately.
