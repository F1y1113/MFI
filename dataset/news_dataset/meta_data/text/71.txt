Friday, June 10, 2022 - The president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, during talks with British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace in the Ukrainian capital on Friday, praised the British leadership and its assistance for Kyiv against the invasion of Russia.

Zelensky expresses his gratitude to Great Britain, the government, and the prime minister. He told Wallace, “The war highlights who is our friend or friends— not just strategic friends, but real friends now. And I believe Great Britain is a friend”.

He also added that Great Britain constantly demonstrates its leadership in “arms, money, and sanctions.

Wallace’s visitation comes a day after two Britons and a Moroccan were sentenced to death by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. The separatist leaders of the latter are backed by Moscow after being captured while fighting for Ukraine.
