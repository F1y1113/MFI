Saturday, July 16, 2022 – The President of the United States, Joe Biden, said that the United States would remain an active and engaged partner in the Middle East. At the Arab summit, he also urged leaders to see human rights as a powerful economic and social change force. 

In Biden’s opening speech to kick off the summit, he said, “The United States is invested in building a positive future for the region in partnership with all of you—and the United States is not going anywhere.”

Biden’s first trip to the Middle East since he became President has seen him focus more on Saturday’s summit with six Gulf states, Egypt, Jordan, and Iraq, while downplaying a meeting with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman. 

Biden’s trip to Saudi Arabia aims to strike a deal on oil production to help drive down the prices of gasoline that are driving inflation to a more than 40-year high.
