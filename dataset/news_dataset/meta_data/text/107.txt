Saturday, July 9, 2022 – The Foreign Minister of China, Wang Yi, has urged his Australian counterpart Penny Wong not to treat China as an opponent but as a partner and to accumulate “positive energy” to improve ties.

Wong said, “The root cause of the difficulties in Chinese and Australian relations in recent years lies in the insistence of previous Australian governments to treat China as an ‘opponent’ and even a ‘threat.’” Wang added that Australia’s words and actions were “irresponsible.”

On Friday, the Foreign Minister of Australia, Penny Wong, said that the meeting with her Chinese counterpart was a first step in achieving a stabilized relationship. Still, it would take time for the trade blockages on Australia to be removed by Beijing.

Wang told Wong at the meeting on Friday that China was conducting “equal exchange and cooperation” based on the needs and requests of the sovereign island nations, the Chinese foreign ministry said.
