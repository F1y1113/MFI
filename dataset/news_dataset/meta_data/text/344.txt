Wednesday, October 25, 2023 – The World Bank confirmed on Wednesday that its board has approved a $1 billion loan to help South Africa reform its energy sector, as they try to overcome regular power cuts that have curbed economic growth.

South Africa’s World Bank director, Marie Francoise Marie-Nelly had earlier said last month that the loan was under discussion and could come soon. He also added that the “reform that was launched by the government would benefit people of South Africa, especially the most vulnerable households, the economy, the environment and also advance the energy transition.”

The World Bank also confirmed that its Development Policy Loan would contribute to a gradual reduction in water and air pollution by reducing how much they rely on coal for power generation.

The government of South Africa promises to split Eskom into three subsidiaries, transmission, generation, and distribution.
