Monday, October 3, 2022 – According to the report from regional officials, at least one ballistic missile was fired by North Korea on an apparent trajectory over Japan. The Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea also confirmed the launch.

From the tweet posted by the office of the Prime Minister of Japan, the projectile is believed to have been launched over the northern Japanese Island of Hokkaido, which marks a potential escalation for North Korean missile launches.

In a statement from the Premier’s office, Japanese civilians were urged “to not approach anything suspicious that is found and to immediately contact the police or fire department.” The recent launch, according to the count by CNN, marks the 23rd missile launch this year, including both ballistic and cruise missiles.

Launches over Japan are rare; the last time a ballistic missile was fired over territorial Japan by North Korea was September 15, 2017.
