Sunday, October 16, 2022 - Authorities confirmed that Russia had opened a criminal investigation after 11 people were shot dead at a military training ground near the Ukrainian border by shooters as fighting raged in eastern and southern Ukraine.

Citing the defense minister, Russia's RIA news agency said two gunmen opened fire during a firearm training exercise, targeting a group of people who had volunteered to fight in Ukraine. The news agency also confirmed that the shooters were shot dead.

Russia's defense ministry confirmed that the attackers were from the former Soviet Republic. Oleksiy Arestovych, a senior Ukrainian official, said the two men were from the mainly Muslim, Central Asian Republic of Tajikistan. They opened fire after an argument over religion broke out.

While announcing the criminal investigation, Russia's Investigative Committee said, "as a result of the incident at a shooting range in Belgorod region, 11 people died from gunshot wounds, and another 15 were injured."
