Tuesday, May 24, 2022 – On his tour of Asia visiting allies, President Biden likened Taiwan to the tensions between Russia and Ukraine in a statement that attracted remarks from the Chinese leadership.

For the second time in many months, the US promised unequivocally that the US is prepared to defend Taiwan if China attacked. Before this time, the United States’ position had been vague regarding the situation.

Chinese Foreign Minister said that Taiwan is inseparable from China, and their position on that is not subject to compromise. He mentioned further that the situation in Ukraine is unlike that of Taiwan, urging the US to abide by the One-China Principle. 

The ties that the US has with China acknowledge the principle of the One Chinese government, but at the same time, its Taiwan Relations Act states that the US must provide the island with the means to defend itself.
