Friday, July 22, 2022 – The European Union expressed anger over MPs’ backing of legislation overriding the post-Brexit arrangement for Northern Ireland by launching four other legal cases against the government of the United Kingdom.

At the House of Commons, the protocol bill for Northern Ireland was cleared at its third hearing by 267 votes to 195 and will arrive at the Lords in the autumn.

The EU court possesses the power to impose multimillion-euro fines on the UK, and its decision could be the first step towards the bloc’s taking punitive action through mechanisms with Brexit deals. 

The commission made a statement on Friday that it was taking legal action partly in light of “the continued passage of the Northern Ireland protocol bill through the UK parliament,” which was said to “go directly against” the spirit of proffering collective solutions to current issues.
