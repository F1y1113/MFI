Friday, December 1, 2023 – Israel launched an attack at targets across Gaza following the end of a seven-day ceasefire on Friday, after the negotiation of the release of more hostages failed overnight. More than 100 Palestinians were killed in the recent attack from Israel.

According to Israel’s military, they confirmed that by lunchtime, they had already attacked 200 targets from land, sea, and air across the north and south of the strip, which include a south city that Israel had ordered civilians to evacuate from, Khan Younis.

Israel confirmed that the reason the truce broke and could not be renewed was because Hamas had failed to release the remaining female hostages in Gaza. According to an Israeli Government spokesperson, Eylon Levy, he said that “Having chosen to hold on to Israeli women, Hamas will now take the mother of all thumping.”
