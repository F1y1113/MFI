Thursday, July 20, 2023 â€“ More than 110 people were injured after the north-eastern Italian region of Veneto was hit by severe weather, including giant hailstones. These events prompted the governor, Luca Zaia, to announce a regional emergency for the affected areas.

Although the heatwave peak passed on Wednesday, Italy remained in the grip of its third heatwave of the summer. According to data, temperatures in Sicily and Sardinia were anticipated to reach around 48 degrees Celsius.

The public protection authority in Rome had set up 28 "heat help points" across the city to avoid citizens and tourists from becoming ill due to the severe temperatures. Some hospitals reported a 20%-25% rise in people appearing at emergency rooms with dehydration or other heat-related disorders.

Farm laborers in Marsica, Abruzzo, worked from 4 a.m. to 11 a.m. to avoid the warmest hours, while factory workers around the country threatened to go on strike due to the high heat.
