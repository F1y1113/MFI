Friday, July 7, 2023 â€“ The National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, confirmed that the United States has decided to send cluster munitions to Ukraine as part of the new military aid package. The approval came after months of debates on whether or not to send the weapons, which were banned by 100 countries, including allies of the United States.

The transfer was approved by the President, Joe Biden. The munitions will be compatible with the 155 mm howitzers the United States provided. The 155 mm howitzers have assisted Ukraine over the last year to win back territories.

The undersecretary of defense for policy, Dr. Colin Kahl, said Ukraine assured the United States that they would not use the cluster munitions in urban areas that civilians populate.
