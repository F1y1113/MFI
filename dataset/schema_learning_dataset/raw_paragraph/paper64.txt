With the development of new energy vehicles, the global demand for nickel resources will continue to grow, coupled with the uncertainty of supply, natural disasters and other supply factors, this resource is very likely to occur supply risks (Zeng et al., 2018b). The whole nickel industrial chain is a multilayer trade system. Understanding the trade structure characteristics, the role of the country in the industrial chain and the layout of a country's industrial chain is an important prerequisite for a country to guarantee its industrial safety, international_mmpetitiveness and sustainable development. Using complex network theory and material flow analysis method, this study constructs a multilayer trade network with six layers of nickel industry chain in 2019. The characteristics of the trade structure of the nickel industrial chain are analyzed, and the core trading countries of each layer are revealed. From the perspectives of participating countries, trade relations between countries and trade flow between industrial chain adjacent layers of a single country, the correlation between adjacent layers of the industrial chain is discussed. These results can provide a basis for future research on supply risk propagation in the global nickel industry chain multilayer trade network. The main conclusions are:
