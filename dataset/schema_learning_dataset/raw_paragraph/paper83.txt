Despite the significant influence of raw materials on LIB production and their potential for reducing GWP, the existing body of LCA studies predominantly focused on other aspects such as cell design, battery specific energy, energy consumption during the manufacturing process, and the electricity mix used (Bouter & Guichet, 2022). Similarly, (Porzio & Scown, 2021 ) concluded that previous LCA studies have not thoroughly investigated the influence of average and marginal sources of key raw materials. However, a more recent study by (Xu et al., 2022) modelled the production of eight LIB cell chemistries using background life cycle inventory (LCI) data that consider future energy scenarios and SübblSidiåiOs of key battery metals. The authors concluded that cell chemistries such as lithium iron phosphate should be widely deployed due to their low GHG emissions, as well as using low-carbon electricity supply in cell production. However, this study used averaged LCIs for primary Ni and Co production, and did not include either electrolytic manganese (Mn) production routes or secondary raw materials. A second study by (Pell & Lindsay, 2022) on the life cycle impacts of solid-state and conventional LIBS concluded that graphite produced in China significantly contributes to the environmental impacts, and recycled battery raw materials may provide an additional source of avoided impacts. However, the study applied a local sensitivity analysis, which limited the examination of the influence of market share among different primary supply routes. Additionally, recycled raw materials were excluded from their analysis. A third study by (Manjong et al., 2021 ) presented extensively parameterized LCIs for battery raw materials' extraction and refining. However, the significance of parameters such as ore grade decline and metal extraction rate from ores during the smelting process on LIB cell production GWP was not evaluated because of the scope of the study.
