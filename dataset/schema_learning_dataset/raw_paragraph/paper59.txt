Future studies should expand the system boundaries to include, e.g., the use phase or the battery production as additional sources for material that must be recycled to derive recommendations that consider the whole battery supply chain. Additionally, more parameters should be considered within the study. For example, current and prospective battery mixes or more recycling routes, such as a pyrometallurgical route, and combinations should be considered as different companies use different recycling routes. Furthermore, the scale of the recycling facilities should be varied to give good recommendations for the size at specific locations based on the spatial concentration of waste batteries.
