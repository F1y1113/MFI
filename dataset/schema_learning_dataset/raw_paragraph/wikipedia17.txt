Nickel mine:
A nickel mine is a mine that produces nickel.

Geology:
Nickel occurs in two general types of ores, sulfides and oxides. The most important sulfide ore is pentlandite (Ni9S8) although many other nickel sulfides are known. Furthermore, nickel is often a constituent of iron sulfides such as pyrrhotite. The principal (i.e. economically most important) nickel oxides are nickeliferous limonite ((Fe1−xNix)O(OH)·nH2O).[1][2] Pentlandite supplies an estimated 65% of the world's nickel but nickel laterites constitute the largest reserves.

Extraction:
Nickel content of its ores is often only a few percent by weight.

Sulfide ores are subjected to comminution followed by froth flotation. Pentlandite and related minerals separate with sulfides of copper, cobalt, and iron.[1]

Two hydrometallurgical methods have been developed to extract nickel and cobalt from nickel laterites, these processes are called sulphuric acid leaching and reduction roast-ammonia leaching. For high-magnesium silicates in lower profiles laterites the exploitation method used is smelting.
