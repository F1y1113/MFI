Responsible mineral sourcing is a major issue on the global sustainability agenda. Spurred by "conflict minerals", debates about the ethics of mineral supply chains now encompass a broad set of concerns including child labor, corruption, environmental degradation, and a green transition away from fossil fuels. The past two decades have seen a flurry of initiatives to clean up supply chains and protect the reputation of major companies. Based on a mapping review of 220 studies of responsible mineral supply chains, this study highlights the approaches that responsible minerals sourcing initiatives have taken, focusing on conflict minerals (tin, tungsten tantalum and gold) as well as metals and minerals needed for renewable energy technologies in a transition to a low carbon economy (cobalt, graphite, lithium, manganese and nickel). We briefly describe the evolution of these initiatives, contrast arguments about mandatory and voluntary approaches, summarize findings regarding their impacts on local communities and corporate actors, and discuss the challenges and opportunities of new technologies and traceability systems.
