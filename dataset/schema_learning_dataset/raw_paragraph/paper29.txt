Li-ion batteries have reached an inflection point. In the course of the next 5-10 years, the industry that manufactures them is expected to grow as much as ten times its current size. The supply chain that feeds the materials into that industry also has to expand at a similar rate. Will it be able to do so? Answering that question is crucial to the future of Li-ion batteries and their ability to solve a host of societal problems, from balancing a renewables-driven electricity grid to electrifying the entire transportation sector.

Going forward, that total amount of cobalt shipments is not very flexible. The vast majority of cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in mines whose primary purpose is the production of copper or iron ore. Cobalt is typically measured in the single digit percentages in proportion to the primary mineral being extracted. Thus, cobalt harvesting rates from these mines is not a factor of cobalt demand or cobalt pricing, but of demand and pricing of the co-extracted minerals. Pure-play cobalt mines simply don't exist in the world today, and only a handful of small cobaltonly resource sites are known to exist.

The metals markets have already registered this scenario. The price of elemental cobalt has more than doubled in the last 12 months to the $50/KG level. With the lack of significant changes in other industries that use cobalt, it's not hard to assume that this price increase is primarily due to expectations surrounding battery industry demand.
