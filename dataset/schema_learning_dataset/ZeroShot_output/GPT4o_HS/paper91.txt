Event 1
event: History and revival of electric vehicles
event_id: ev1
description: Electric vehicles (EVs) were popular in the early 1900s, with significant advancements made by Thomas Davenport and widespread use in cities like New York. The mass-produced gas-powered Model T by Henry Ford in 1908 led to a decline in EVs until their recent revival.
