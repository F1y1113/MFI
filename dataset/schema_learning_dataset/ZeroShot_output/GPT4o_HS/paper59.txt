Event 1
event: Expanding system boundaries and considering additional parameters in future studies
event_id: ev1
description: Future studies should expand system boundaries to include additional sources of material that must be recycled, such as the use phase or battery production. They should also consider more parameters, including current and prospective battery mixes, different recycling routes, and varying scales of recycling facilities.
participants: system boundaries ev1.1_P1, additional parameters ev1.2_P1, battery mixes ev1.3_P1, recycling routes ev1.4_P1, recycling facility scale ev1.5_P1
