According to these paragraphs:

can you extract a hierarchical structure from them for me, the hierarchical structure example should be like:
Event 1
event: xxxx
event_id: ev1
description: xxxx
participants: xxxx ev1.1_P0.5, xxxx ev1.2_P0.5, xxxx ev1.3_P1
Gate: and
Relations: ev1.1>ev1.2, ev1.3>ev1.1


Subevent 1.1
subevent: xxxx
event_id: ev1.1
description: xxxx
participants: xxxx
Gate: xxxx
Relations: xxxx
...
And I hope you to continue building this hierarchical structure as further and detailed as possible,
where 'event' refers to anything that takes place or happens related to the ev batteries supply chain, and there can be multiple ‘event’s, 
'event_id' is a unique number representing this event
'description' is the detailed 2-3 sentences explanation about this event,
'participants' refers to all subevents related to this event, and you can use 'subsubevent' if a event is included by a subevent or ‘subsubsubevent’ if a event is included by a subsubevent and you can continue using ‘subsubsubsubevent’,  ‘subsubsubsubsubevent’, …
The suffix ‘P0.5’ refers to the probability that a subevent is included by an event. For example, ‘ev1.1_P0.5’ in the above example refers to the probability that ‘ev1.1’ is included by ‘ev1’ is 0.5. Please use value ‘1’ if you are strongly determined, and use value ‘0.5’ if you are weakly determined.
‘Gate’ refers to the relation between an event and all its sub-events, if an event consists of multiple sub-events and no part of them can be missing, use gate ‘and’. If an event consists of multiple sub-events, it can still exist even if some parts are missing, use gate ‘or’. If an event consists of multiple sub-events, but these sub-events cannot exist at the same time, use gate ‘xor’.
‘Relations’ refers to collectively specified event-event relations, for example, if ev1.2 is caused by (happen after) ev1.1, which can be expressed as ‘ev1.1>ev1.2’ . If there is no relation between participants of a ‘event’, set the ‘relations’ as ‘xxxx’ 
'xxxx' refers to the information you can fill in with extracted info from my input paragraphs, 
each event needs to be separated by spaces
here is an extraction process example:
for the paragraph 'Three main methods are used in lithium-ion recycling: pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgical, bioleaching, and direct recycling [67,68,69]. The battery is melted in a hot furnace to recover some of the cathode metal in pyrometallurgy. Pyrometallurgy employs extreme heat to transform metal oxides into cobalt, copper, iron, and nickel alloys. Although it has a straightforward process and a reasonably mature technology, the main drawbacks are its high cost and high environmental pollution. Hydrometallurgy is a metal recovery method involving aqueous solutions to perform leaching processes to precipitate a particular metal. In hydrometallurgy, specialized solution reagents are primarily used to leach the targeted metals out from the cathode substance [70]. Although it is a highly effective and power-efficient method, its drawbacks include a lengthy production time and a complicated process. Combinations of both pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy are also used due to their advantages in sorting starting materials for cells. The bioleaching technique uses bacteria to retrieve precious metals, but it is challenging because the bacteria need a substantial amount of time to grow and are easily susceptible to contamination.'
A simple hierarchical structure can be extracted from the above paragraph is:
“Event 1
event: lithium-ion recycling
event_id: ev1
description: xxxx
participants: pyrometallurgical ev1.1_P1, hydrometallurgical ev1.2_P1, bioleaching ev1.3_P1
Gate: or
Relations: ev1.1>ev1.3, ev1.2>ev1.3


Subevent 1.1
subevent:pyrometallurgical 
event_id: ev1.1
description: employs extreme heat to transform metal oxides into cobalt, copper, iron, and nickel alloys
participants: metal oxides ev1.1.1_P1, cobalt ev1.1.2_P0.5, copper ev1.1.3_P0.5, iron ev1.1.4_P0.5, nickel alloys ev1.1.5_P0.5
Gate: and
Relations: ev1.1.1>ev1.1.2, ev1.1.1>ev1.1.3, ev1.1.1>ev1.1.4, ev1.1.1>ev1.1.5




Subevent 1.2
subevent:Hydrometallurgy
event_id: ev1.2
description: specialized solution reagents are primarily used to leach the targeted metals out from the cathode substance
participants: xxxx
Gate: xxxx
Relations: xxxx


Subevent 1.3
subevent:bioleaching
event_id: ev1.3
description: uses bacteria to retrieve precious metals
participants: xxxx
Gate: xxxx
Relations: xxxx”
Let’s think about this extracted structure step by step:
Starting with the first sentence in the paragraph ‘Three main methods are used in lithium-ion recycling: pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgical, bioleaching, and direct recycling [67,68,69].’ From this sentence, we can learn that ‘pyrometallurgical’, ‘hydrometallurgical’, ‘bioleaching, and direct recycling’ are three methods of ‘lithium-ion recycling’, so select ‘lithium-ion recycling’ as event, and the three methods as subevent and participants of ‘lithium-ion recycling’.
