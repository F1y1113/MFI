Saturday, July 9, 2022 – The Foreign Minister of China, Wang Yi, has urged his Australian counterpart Penny Wong not to treat China as an opponent but as a partner and to accumulate “positive energy” to improve ties.

Wong said, “The root cause of the difficulties in Chinese and Australian relations in recent years lies in the insistence of previous Australian governments to treat China as an ‘opponent’ and even a ‘threat.’” Wang added that Australia’s words and actions were “irresponsible.”

On Friday, the Foreign Minister of Australia, Penny Wong, said that the meeting with her Chinese counterpart was a first step in achieving a stabilized relationship. Still, it would take time for the trade blockages on Australia to be removed by Beijing.

Wang told Wong at the meeting on Friday that China was conducting “equal exchange and cooperation” based on the needs and requests of the sovereign island nations, the Chinese foreign ministry said.

Wednesday, July 13, 2022 – The President of Sri Lanka, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, hours before his resignation, fled the country to the Maldives on a military jet. This results from anti-government protesters taking over his presidential palace and office.

As protesters continued storming government offices, the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, declared a state of emergency after the President’s departure. Wickremesinghe has been appointed the acting President by Rajapaksa, A Sri Lankan official said.

Sri Lanka’s air force made a statement to confirm Rajapaksa’s departure on Wednesday after he invoked executive powers to enable his escape. “Under the provisions of the constitution and on a request by the government, the Sri Lanka air force provided a plane early today to fly the president, his wife, and two security officials to the Maldives.” They arrived in Male, the capital of Maldives, at 3 am.

Saturday, July 2, 2022 – In the southern Iranian province of Hormozgan, a powerful earthquake and accompanying aftershocks have resulted in at least five fatalities and more than 50 wounded.

The earthquake struck at 02:00 local time on Saturday near the coast, around 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Bandar Abbas, where the province headquarters is situated.

Although there were two equally strong aftershocks, the deceased was said to have perished in the magnitude-six earthquake, according to government media. Aftershocks from the earthquake were felt nearby in the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf states.

Officials from the area have said that Sayeh Khosh’s hamlet was destroyed.

Iran, which relies on large geological fault lines, has recently seen some earthquakes that have significantly damaged the country. Over a thousand people died in a similar disaster that struck Afghanistan in June.

Automotive giant Ford is shoring up its battery supply chain — partly by importing lower-cost, iron-based batteries popular in China — as it sprints to increase electric vehicle production.

Why it matters: Employing cheaper, safer and more durable iron batteries could accelerate demand for mass-market electric vehicles (EVs), and help automakers sidestep nickel and cobalt supply problems that have been driving up EV prices.

The big picture: Carmakers' plans to shift away from gasoline-powered vehicles won't succeed unless they can secure reliable battery supplies. But with raw materials in short supply — and sourced primarily in Asia — the battery race is turning into a fierce geopolitical competition.

Driving the news: Ford said Thursday it had lined up enough batteries to meet its short-term goal of producing 600,000 EVs annually by 2023, up dramatically from the 27,140 battery-powered cars it sold in the U.S. last year.

The company, which is spending $50 billion to expand its EV lineup, also said it was 70% to its goal of securing enough batteries to produce 2 million EVs annually by 2026.
Ford announced a slew of supplier deals and partnerships — including contracts to buy raw materials directly from mining companies, as other automakers have done.
Details: One way Ford intends to meet its EV targets: adding a second type of battery chemistry to its lineup called lithium iron phosphate (LFP), alongside its existing nickel cobalt manganese (NCM) chemistry.

It will initially import LFP battery packs from China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd. (CATL) for its Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning pickup, starting next year.
But Ford also wants to produce LFP batteries in North America, and plans to open a 40-GWh LFP cell factory by 2026. (That's in addition to three previously announced battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky.)
Between the lines: Iron and phosphorous are abundant, which is why LFP cells cost at least 30% less than today's nickel- and cobalt-based batteries, Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Guidehouse Insights, explains in Forbes.

And they're less likely to catch fire because the chemistry is more stable.
Yes, but: LFP batteries pack 30% less energy than similarly-sized nickel-rich batteries, which translates into shorter driving range.

This isn't a huge issue in China because buyers there care more about price and durability than driving range.
But Americans, who aspire to take long road trips, want longer-range EVs capable of going 300 miles or more between charges.
Instead of installing a larger battery to meet their range expectations, carmakers can squeeze more LFP cells into battery packs by redesigning their module structure, per Abuelsamid.
What to watch: Tesla increasingly uses cobalt-free LFP batteries in its entry-level vehicles, and it's expected Ford and others will too.

Meanwhile, nickel-based batteries will be used for pricier performance cars.
What they're saying: "We know that the battery material cost is where the war will be won in the short term," said Lisa Drake, vice president of EV industrialization for Ford's Model e division.
