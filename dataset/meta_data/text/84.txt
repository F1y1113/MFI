Wednesday, June 22, 2022 – Tens of thousands of people in southern China have been evacuated due to flooding, and more rain is expected.

Guangdong’s manufacturing hub suspended classes, office work, and public transportation due to rising waters and the threat of landslides. Almost 500,000 people in the neighboring province of Jiangxi have had their homes damaged and their lives uprooted.

In Guangdong, roughly the same number of people have been affected, primarily in Shaoguan, Heyuan, and Meizhou.

During the summer months, flooding is common in China, particularly in the central and southern regions that receive the most rainfall. The worst floods in recent years in China occurred in 1998 when over 2,000 people died, and nearly 3 million homes were destroyed, mostly along China’s largest river, the Yangtze.

The government has significantly invested in flood control and hydroelectric projects, such as the massive Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River.
