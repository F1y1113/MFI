Monday, July 4, 2022 – Ukrainian forces are prepared to hoist the national flag on Snake Island, a strategically significant outpost in the Black Sea, after Russian troops withdrew following months of intense shelling.

Ukraine has viewed control of the island as a crucial first step in easing Moscow’s embargo of its southern ports even though it is exposed to bombing. It remained unclear if Ukrainian soldiers would try to maintain a long-term presence there.

It gained international attention when Russia originally took control of Snake Island in February. Ukrainian forces have made multiple attempts to recover it since Russia assumed control.

Russia said it had left the island on Thursday as a “gesture of goodwill,” demonstrating that it was not impeding United Nations efforts to build a humanitarian corridor. Volodymyr Zelenskiy stated that although the withdrawal did not ensure the security of the Black Sea region, it would “seriously limit” Russian activity there.
