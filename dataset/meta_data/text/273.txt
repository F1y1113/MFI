Wednesday, May 31, 2023 – Scientists from the Earth Commission provide troubling evidence that our world is facing rising problems in water supply, fertilizer loading, ecosystem management, and aerosol pollution. These endanger the stability of life-support systems and exacerbate socioeconomic inequality.

According to scientists, we have reached a saturation point where we have surpassed the limit of the Earth system's biophysical capacity to remain stable. “We are approaching tipping points, with more severe damage to global life-support systems.”

The study establishes a set of "safe and just" environmental criteria that may be compared to the vital signs of the human body. It examines indicators such as water flow, phosphorus usage, and land conversion rather than pulse, temperature, and blood pressure. The boundaries are based on a review of prior research conducted by universities and UN science organizations.
