Monday, April 11, 2022 - Brazil's Amazon rainforest has reached a sad milestone with the highest deforestation levels ever recorded. The country's National Institute for Space Research released findings that 363 square miles of trees and vegetation have been removed from the basin within the first three months of this year alone, which is the highest level of deforestation since the corporation's first study conducted in 2016.

As the largest remaining rainforest on the globe, the Amazon is responsible not only for air quality, water resources, and battling against global warming, but also provides a safe ecosystem and habitat for animals, insects, and plants alike that is essential for their continued survival. However, the security of the Amazon has been severely impacted since 2019 when President Jair Bolsonaro came into power, choosing instead to replace environmental safeguards with economical pursuits, leading in part to this unfortunate milestone.
