Thursday, November 16, 2023 â€“ Almost 3,000 towns and communities in Brazil have received red alerts because of an unusual heatwave. The heat has affected over a hundred million people and is predicted to linger for a few more days.

Rio de Janeiro recorded 42.5 degrees Celsius on Sunday, a record for November, and heavy humidity on Tuesday made it seem like 58.5 degrees Celsius, according to municipal authorities, while The National Institute of Meteorology reported average temperatures of 37.3 degrees Celsius in Sao Paulo on Tuesday afternoon.

Officials blamed it on the El Nio phenomenon which is typically responsible for increased global temperature as well as climate change that is causing the increased frequency and duration of extreme weather events.

The heatwave, which arrives more than a month before the start of summer in the southern hemisphere, has caused Brazil's energy usage to reach new highs as people strive to stay cool.
