Friday, July 1, 2022 – The Russian-backed self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) stated it has accused two more British people of being “mercenaries.” An inquiry against British "mercenaries" Dylan Healy and Andrew Hill is currently underway. They face the same charges as the three previously convicted mercenaries.

The UK Foreign Office criticized the “political exploitation” of inmates. It said it had highlighted the issue with the Russian authorities. According to a spokesperson, he said: “We are in close communication with the Ukrainian government about their situations and firmly support Ukraine’s attempts to free them.”

This is the second time Britons will be apprehended during the Russia-Ukraine crisis. The first set apprehended were sentenced to death by firing squad but were given an ultimatum to appeal before July 9. The European Court of Human Rights has granted “interim measures” that would prevent the execution of the mercenaries.
