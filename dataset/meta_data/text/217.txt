Friday, January 27, 2023 — Kyiv’s ambassador to France says Ukraine is set to receive more than 300 tanks from Western countries. Vadym Omelchenko said, “as of today, numerous countries have officially confirmed their agreement to deliver 321 heavy tanks to Ukraine.”

Omelchenko arrived at the figure after the United States promised to deliver 31 M1 Abrams tanks, and Germany also agreed to provide 14 Leopard 2 A6s. The interview of Omelchenko came after the United States and North Korea accused its allies of crossing the line by providing tanks for Ukraine.

The sister of the leader of North Korea, Kim Yo Jong, on Friday, accused the US and other western countries of “wrecking the global peace and the regional security, while handling military hardware over to Ukraine in total disregard of Russia’s concern about security.”

It is, however, unclear when the tanks will arrive in Ukraine.
