Thursday, June 8, 2023 – According to US scientists, El Nino, a natural weather occurrence has begun in the Pacific Ocean, potentially adding heat to global warming due to climate change. They are concerned that it will contribute to the planet exceeding the critical 1.5C warming threshold.

El Nino, a hot phase that happens every two to seven years, causes warm seas to rise to the surface off the coast of South America and spread throughout the ocean, releasing huge amounts of heat into the atmosphere. According to the scientists, since May, the ocean has been 0.5°C hotter than normal for a month, the atmosphere is responding to the heat, and there is evidence that the event is continuing.

Record warm years, such as 2016, the world's hottest on record, typically occur the year following a powerful El Nino event. It will also impact global weather, potentially causing drought in Australia, increased rain in the southern United States, and decreasing India's monsoon.
