Wednesday, April 12, 2023 — Japan has announced plans to develop long-range missiles due to increased tension with China. The Ministry of Defense in Japan has signed contracts with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). The deal involves the development and mass production of the weapons under a plan that extends to 2027. The deals are said to be worth more than $2.8 billion.

Under the new deal, MHI will begin mass production of two types of missiles already developed this year. The two missiles are ground-launched Type 12 guided missiles, designed to target ships at sea, and hypersonic glide missiles, designed for island defense.

MHI, at the same time, is expected to begin the development of submarine-launched missiles, which could be launched by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force’s fleet of conventionally powered boats.
