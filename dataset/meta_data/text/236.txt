Monday, March 20, 2023 — The President of China, Xi Jinping, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Kremlin on Monday. This is the first visit of the Chinese leader to Russia since the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year.

In the early hours of their meeting, both countries talked about the war in Ukraine, and it is expected to be the key point of discussion throughout Xi’s visit. Russian state news agency confirmed that the meeting between the two presidents lasted up to 4 and a half hours, with a more formal meeting expected to follow on Tuesday.

Antony Blinken, a top United States diplomat, said President Xi’s trip to Russia days after the ICC issued an arrest warrant for President Putin suggests that China does not feel any responsibility to hold Kremlin responsible for the war crime committed in Ukraine.
