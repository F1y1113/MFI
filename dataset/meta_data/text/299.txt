Friday, July 28, 2023 – Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani has pronounced himself as the new leader of Niger after he staged a coup. The coup happened on Wednesday when the presidential guard he led staged a coup and seized the country’s president. President Mohamed Bazoum is reportedly in good health and still being held captive by his guards.

France, however, said it does not recognize any of the coup leaders and will only recognize Mr. Bazoum as head of state. The foreign ministry of France said in a statement that “they reiterate in the strongest terms the international community’s apparent demand for the immediate restoration of constitutional order and democratically elected civilian power.

International bodies have condemned the coup, including African Union, the West African regional bloc (ECOWAS), the European Union, and the United Nations.
