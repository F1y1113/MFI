Wednesday, December 21, 2022 - The president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, after arriving in the United States on his first foreign visit since the invasion of Ukraine, told the congress that aid to Ukraine is not a charity but an investment in democracy. He thus seeks more support from the United States for Ukraineâ€™s war effort.

Before the arrival of the Ukrainian President, Antony Blinken, the Secretary of State announced that Ukraine would receive another $1.85 billion military aid from the United States, including a Patriot air defense system to help defend itself against Russian missiles.

About $50 billion in assistance have been sent to Ukraine by the United States dues to the biggest land conflict Europe has ever seen since World War II. But concern about the price tag has been shown by Republicans who will take control of the House of Representatives on Jan 3.
