Wednesday, March 22, 2023 — The International Monetary Fund (IMF) confirmed that a staff-level agreement had been reached with Ukraine on funding worth $15.6bn (£12.8bn). This will be the first loan of the organization to a country at war, and it is expected to be approved in the coming weeks.

An official of the IMF, Gavin Gray, said in a statement that “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to have a devastating impact on the economy. Activity contracted by 30% in 2022, a large share of the capital stock has been destroyed and poverty level has increased.”

The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Denys Shmyhal, said the funding would help Ukraine finance all critical expenditures and ensure macroeconomic stability. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said an IMF program that is appropriately conditioned is critical to underpin Ukraine’s reform effort.
