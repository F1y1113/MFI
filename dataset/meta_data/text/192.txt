Friday, December 23, 2022 – Three people have been killed, and others wounded as a gunman opened fire in central Paris. A Kurdish Cultural Centre seems to have been the primary target of the attacker, where he shot members of the local community. 

In a short statement by the Kurdish Democratic Council (CDF-K), which was in charge of the center, they condemned the attack and said tribute would be paid to those killed during a vigil on Friday evening.

Anne Hidalgo, Paris Mayor, said she believed that a far-right activist committed the Murder. She added that “Kurds wherever they reside, must be able to live in peace and security. More than ever, Paris is by their side in these dark times.”

Prosecutors have launched a murder investigation.
