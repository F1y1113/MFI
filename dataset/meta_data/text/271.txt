Saturday, June 24, 2023 – It was confirmed that Troops from the Wagner mercenary have started leaving the city of Rostov-on-Don less than 24 hours after attempting a rebellion. The group’s chief said he had told his crew to return to Ukraine earlier to avoid bloodshed. Wagner Group is a private army of mercenaries who have been fighting alongside the regular Russian army in Ukraine.

The agreement to de-escalate the matter quickly came after the leader of Belarus; Alexander Lukashenko, held talks with Prigozhin. It was confirmed that the charges against Yevgeny Prigozhin will now be dropped, and he will move to Belarus. 

It was believed that Mr. Putin, the President of Russia, had been flown out of Moscow after flight tracking showed that two presidential planes had left the city on Saturday. However, his press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the president was still in the Kremlin.
