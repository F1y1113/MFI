Thursday, November 9, 2023 â€“ Fires have historically been a prevalent occurrence in the forests of Canada. However, specialists assert that this year's wildfire served as a dire portent of the kind of circumstances that will be engendered by the climate crisis. 

The climate crisis is contributing to the escalation of wildfires in intensity and size through altered precipitation patterns and elevated temperatures. A remarkable 45.7 million acres, or roughly twice the size of Portugal, were consumed by wildfires, nearly tripling the previous annual record.

The boreal forests of Canada, a vital repository of carbon and a haven for species including moose, bears, and songbirds, were the primary target of the fires. Due to the extreme intensity of some of these fires, it is uncertain whether the boreal forest's predominate fir and spruce trees will return to their former positions.

The fires' effects extended well beyond the borders of Canada, resulting in smoke columns that cast a dystopian orange hue over New York City in June and hazy conditions as recently as last month in Florida.
