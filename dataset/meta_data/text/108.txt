Sunday, July 10, 2022 – Eastern Ukraine town Chasiv Yar was hit by a Russian rocket, destroying a five-story apartment building and leaving at least six people dead.

The governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said the town of about 12,000 was hit by Uragan rockets from truck-borne systems. Chasiv Yar, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southeast of Kramatorsk, is a city expected to be an essential target of Russian forces as they grind westward.

Luhansk and the Donetsk region are the two provinces that make up the Donbas region, where separatist rebels have fought Ukrainian forces since 2014. Russia captured the city of Lysychansk last week, the last major stronghold of the Ukrainian resistance in Luhansk.

On Saturday, Luhansk governor, Serhiy Haidai said that Russian forces are raising “true hell” in the Donbas, despite assessments that they are taking operational rest. But, “So far, there has been no operational pause announced by the enemy. He is still attacking and shelling our lands with the same intensity as before,” Haidai said.
