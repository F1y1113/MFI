Saturday, March 4, 2023 – An official economic growth target of about 5% has been set by China for 2023. After slow growth due to the pandemic measures, China seeks to revive the world’s second-largest economy. The defense budget will also be increased to 7.2%

Both figures were revealed at the opening of the annual gathering of the National People’s Congress, where 3,000 delegates converged in Beijing for a period of eight days. Li Keqiang, the outgoing Premier, said during the opening of the congress that “China’s economy is staging a steady recovery and demonstrating vast potential and momentum for further growth.”

The National People’s Congress meeting is an important annual political event alongside the gathering of top political advisers in China. The event known together is referred to as the Two Sessions.
