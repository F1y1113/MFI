Friday, June 17, 2022 – China has launched its third aircraft carrier, the first to be designed and built entirely in the country; the event marked a turn in military advance for the Asian superpower.

The launch happened in a Shanghai shipyard. The "Fujian" is more technically advanced than the other Chinese carriers. State broadcaster CCTV said it is the “first catapult carrier wholly designed and built by China.”

In China, the "Liaoning", commissioned in 2012, and the "Shandong", which entered service in 2019, are the two other aircraft carriers. They use a ski-jump-style platform to launch aircraft, unlike the "Fujian", which uses a catapult launcher system.

The Chinese defense minister, Wei Fenghe, warned his US counterpart last week that if Taiwan declared independence, Beijing would “not hesitate to start a war, no matter the cost.”
