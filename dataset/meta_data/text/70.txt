Monday, June 6, 2022 - Nupur Sharma, National spokesperson, and Naveen Kumar Jindal, Delhi media head of India's ruling Party, have been suspended after their comments against the Islamic Prophet Muhammed were met with protests in the middle east.

Prominent Gulf countries have described the comments as “insulting,” as many of them summon the respective Indian ambassador to their Nations. Concerns about the dangerous levels of Islamophobic discourse and Islamophobic actions against Indian Muslims were also raised

There was no initial reaction from the ruling Party immediately after the statements were rebuked. However, as boycott and sanctions against India grew momentum, the government tried to dismiss the comments as “fringe elements” within the Party, and do not, in any manner, reflect the views of the government of India.”

Both spokesmen have been fired by the BJP, which stated that “strong action will be taken against individuals who make insulting statements.” 

Ardent supporters of the Ruling Party have spoken out against the decision to expel the spokespeople as a cowardly act by the BJP.
