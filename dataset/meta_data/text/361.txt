Tuesday, December 12, 2023 â€“ The General Assembly of the United Nations has voted to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. The votes oppose the United States, which has repeatedly blocked ceasefire calls in the United Nations Security Council. During the General Assembly emergency special session on Tuesday, 153 nations voted for the ceasefire, 10 voted against it and 23 abstained.

Although the vote of the General Assembly is politically significant, it majorly carries a moral weight, and it is nonbinding, unlike a Security Council resolution. Last week, the United States vetoed a ceasefire resolution in the Security Council, which had already been approved.

Israel has vowed not to stop its military campaign until it has eradicated the Palestinian group Hamas, which controls Gaza, after its October 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people.
