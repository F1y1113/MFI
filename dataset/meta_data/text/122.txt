Monday, August 1, 2022 – According to a Reuters poll taken over the past week, the Bank of England is expected to raise borrowing costs by 50 basis points to 1.75% on Thursday due to rising inflation. Since the Bank of England became independent in 1997, it has never raised bank rates by a half point. 

In December, Britain’s central bank, amongst its major peers, was the first to raise interest rates, setting a precedent for its peers to play catch-up. The second consecutive meeting last week saw the US Federal Reserve raise interest rates by 75 basis points, and the Bank of Canada last hiked by 100 basis points. 

Fabrice Montagne at Barclays said they “expect the MPC to quicken the pace of tightening to 50 basis points.” We think the bank needs to demonstrate resolution in the face of ever-increasing inflationary risks, or it could lose control of the narrative.”
