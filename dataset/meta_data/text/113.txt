Wednesday, July 20, 2022 – The former Sri Lanka Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, was elected by the lawmakers as the president of the crisis-hit South Asian country. This move will likely anger the protesters since they have demanded his removal from office for weeks.

Wickremesinghe, who is a six-time former prime minister and an essential ally of the former President, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, won a parliamentary ballot after his predecessor ran away from the country due to an escalating protest over an economic crisis marked by a dire shortage of essential imports such as food, medicine, and fuel. He received 134 votes out of a possible 223.

While Wickremesinghe addressed the country shortly after being elected president by the lawmakers, he said, “While the country has been divided into party lines, the time has come to work together.”

As the voting was in progress, a small group of protesters gathered at the president’s residence to protest Wickremesinghe’s nomination.
