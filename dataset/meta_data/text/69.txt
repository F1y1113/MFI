Sunday, June 5, 2022 - Several explosions rocked Kyiv in the early hours of Sunday, a day after officials said its troops recaptured the eastern battlefield city of Sievierodonetsk in a counter-offensive against Russia.

Klitschko said at least one person was hospitalized, but no deaths had been reported early Sunday. Other officials said the railway network appeared to be the target of the Russian bombardment. 

On Sunday, the governor of the Luhansk region, including Sievierodonetsk, Serhly, and Gaidai, said that Ukrainian forces controlled about half the city after recapturing a large chunk from Russian troops.  

On Saturday, mayor Oleksandr Stryuk told national television that “the situation is tense and complicated. Our military is doing everything to drive the enemy out of the city.”
