Sunday, June 5, 2022 - According to the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff, North Korea fired eight short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) into the waters off its east coast in an unprecedented move.

The missiles were launched in North Korea into waters east of the Korean peninsula from multiple sites between 9:08 a.m. and 9:43 a.m. Seoul local time on Sunday. This is the third missile test by North Korea since the new South Korean president took office on May 10.

The Japanese Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, protested the launch, saying it violated UN resolutions.

Japan’s Defense Ministry also reported that six of the missiles reached a maximum altitude of between 50 to 100 kilometers (31 to 62 miles) and traveled a distance of about 300 to 400 kilometers (186 to 249 miles).

Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Won In-Choul also held a virtual meeting with the Commander of the ROK-US Combined Forces Command, Paul LaCamera. They reaffirmed their defense’s capability to immediately detect and intercept North Korean missiles.
