Wednesday, July 13, 2022 – Several days of scorching weather have been reported in the UK. New development rolls out as the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, triggered the severe weather emergency response in the county’s capital.

Directions have been sent to all London boroughs to conduct welfare checks on vulnerable people and provide sunscreens, water, and instructions about safety and navigating the heat. 

The hot spell is expected to continue for days and peak on Monday or Tuesday.

Mr. Khan acknowledged the challenging period for rough sleepers, with temperatures predicted to exceed the UK heat record of 38.7C set in 2019.

Heatwaves have become hotter, more frequent, and have longer durations because of climate change. According to experts, the heatwave is due to hot air flow from inland Europe. Experts also advised that the homes in the UK should be adapted to more intense occurrences in the future.
