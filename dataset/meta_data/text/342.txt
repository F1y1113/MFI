Saturday, October 21, 2023 â€“ After almost a week of negotiations between the United States, Israel, Egypt and the United Nations, the Rafah crossing point between Egypt and Gaza has been opened. The opening will allow 20 Egyptian trucks containing medical supplies to cross into the territory.

According to the agreement, only 20 trucks will be permitted to enter on Saturday, and a UN official said trucks from the UN will not be expected to cross until Monday.

The government of Israel said that they want proof that the aid deliveries are not seized or diverted by Hamas before they can authorize any further deliveries. An official of the United Nations said that the verification procedures are still under discussion. The director general of the World Health Organization confirmed that the medical supplies that are being sent to Gaza include trauma and chronic disease medicine.
