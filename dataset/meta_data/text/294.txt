Friday, July 21, 2023 – The ambassador of Ukraine to London has been dismissed by the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. His dismissal comes shortly after the Ukrainian president was asked to be more grateful for the military help that has been provided to them by the West.

According to a presidential order, Vadym Prystaiko’s dismissal was announced without any official reason, and he was also removed as Ukraine’s representative to the International Maritime Organization. Tension grew between Prystaiko and Zelenskiy when Prystaiko went on Sky News to question some of the behavior of the Ukrainian president. 

However, the tension with the West appears to have reduced, with some Ukrainians believing that enough is not being said about their troops dying on the battlefield every day. They added that the troops do not only fight to regain their sovereignty but also to defend Western values.
