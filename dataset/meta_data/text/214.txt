Tuesday, January 24, 2023 – Recent reports claim that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has decided to deliver Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine to help them in their war against Russia. There is set to be a debate about the issue in the German parliament on Wednesday morning.

Germany came to a conclusion to send the tanks to Ukraine just after the United States revealed that the administration of Biden is wrapping up plans to send tanks made in the United States to Ukraine.

Ukraine will be able to defend itself better against Russia's offensive with the Leopard 2 tanks that are been sent to them by Germany. 

Germany has resisted much pressure to ship some of the tanks to Ukraine. Germany’s Minister for defense, Boris Pistorius on several times, called for more time, insisting that the move would come with pros and cons for Berlin.
