Friday, March 17, 2023 â€” An arrest warrant was issued for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Russian official Maria Lvova-Belova, by the International Criminal Court (ICC). The two individuals were alleged of a scheme to have Ukrainian children deported to Russia.

The court said it has enough evidence to believe that Mr. Putin is guilty of the crime he was accused of, having committed them directly alongside others. The court also said Mr. Putin has failed to exercise proper control over civilian and military subordinates who committed the acts. 

During his nightly address on Friday, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, appreciated the ICC for its decision. He also said the investigations by Ukraine suggest that Kremlin was directly involved in the forced deportation of children into Russia.
