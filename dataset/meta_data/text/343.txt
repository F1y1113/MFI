Sunday, October 22, 2023 â€“ A missile that hit a distribution center in Ukraine has killed six postal workers and left 14 other workers injured. The president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, posted on Telegram that the Nova Poshta sorting office was struck in Kharkiv. He confirmed that rescue operations were being carried out and emergency services were working at the scene of the incident.

The regional Governor of Kharkiv, Oleh Syniehubov said that all the victims worked for the postal company. He wrote on his Telegram that the victims of the strike were aged between 19 and 42.

Russia has yet to comment on the strike but has always denied ever targeting civilians during its invasion of Ukraine.

The city of Kharkiv which is not too far from the Russian border was heavily bombed during the first week of invasion in February. The mayor of Kharkiv said earlier this month that the first-ever underground school in Ukraine would be built in the city to allow children to go to school safely.
