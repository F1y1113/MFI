Saturday, November 12, 2022 – In a fiery pre-election rebuff to China, President Tsai Ing-wan of Taiwan said her life’s mission was to ensure the island continued to belong to its people and the existence of Taiwan was a provocation to no one.

Taiwan’s local elections coming up on Nov. 26 comes a month after President of China, Xi Jinping, who had ramped up military pressure on the democratically-governed island to accept Beijing’s sovereignty, secured a precedent-breaking third leadership term.

At the rally for her ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), she told everyone that “the existence of Taiwan and Taiwanese people's insistence on freedom and democracy is not a provocation to anyone.” She also added that it is her calling as President to make every effort to let Taiwan still be the Taiwan of the Taiwanese people.
