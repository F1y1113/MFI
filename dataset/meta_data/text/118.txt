Saturday, July 2, 2022 – In the southern Iranian province of Hormozgan, a powerful earthquake and accompanying aftershocks have resulted in at least five fatalities and more than 50 wounded.

The earthquake struck at 02:00 local time on Saturday near the coast, around 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Bandar Abbas, where the province headquarters is situated.

Although there were two equally strong aftershocks, the deceased was said to have perished in the magnitude-six earthquake, according to government media. Aftershocks from the earthquake were felt nearby in the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf states.

Officials from the area have said that Sayeh Khosh’s hamlet was destroyed.

Iran, which relies on large geological fault lines, has recently seen some earthquakes that have significantly damaged the country. Over a thousand people died in a similar disaster that struck Afghanistan in June.
