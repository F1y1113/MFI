Monday, February 6, 2023 â€“ Earthquakes hit the border of Turkiye and Syria, leading to widespread disorder and destruction in the two countries. A first Earthquake of magnitude 7.8 hit south of the East Anatolian fault, which separates the Anatolian plate and the Arabian plate, while a second quake of magnitude 7.5 hit north of the Faultline.

Since the incident, the death toll has continued to rise, with a count of over 12,000 people killed in the disaster. Sources report that the death toll could go much higher because the widespread destruction has led to the delay in emergency services reaching the affected area.

Authorities reported that up to 10 cities were affected in Turkiye. In Syria, Aleppo, which contained more than a million refugees fleeing from war, is one of the most affected cities in Syria.

Criticism has grown as families in some hard-hit communities have complained that the delayed pace of rescue attempts has left them digging for relatives alone.

International support has arrived from major countries as Leaders of both Syria and Turkiye have acknowledged that there was no way to prepare for an earthquake and that they cannot face the disaster alone.
