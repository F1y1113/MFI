Thursday, December 8, 2022 – WNBA player Brittney Griner was released as part of a prisoner swap involving Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.

Griner’s February detention in Russia caused diplomatic turmoil between the US and the Kremlin that played out alongside Russia’s war in Ukraine. Along with severe sanctions in reaction to the Ukraine war, US officials also maintained contact with Moscow over prisoner discussions.

She had been held since February when she was caught on drug smuggling accusations at an airport in the Moscow region. She had played in the off-season for a Russian women's basketball club. She was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was transferred to a Mordovia republic penal colony in mid-November after losing her appeal.

Bout, dubbed the "Merchant of Death," is a former Soviet military commander receiving a 25-year jail sentence in the United States for planning to kill Americans, acquiring and exporting anti-aircraft missiles, and providing material support to a terrorist group. A sentence that Moscow called "baseless and biased."
