Thursday, April 27, 2023 – The United States has promised South Korea that it would give them more insight into its nuclear planning over any conflict with North Korea.

The announcement resulted from talks between United States President Joe Biden and the President of South Korea, Yoon Suk Yeol, that included a discussion about North Korea, semiconductor chips and trade, and the war in Ukraine. The deal also states that South Korea will not pursue a nuclear bomb.

While speaking at a joint news conference, the President of South Korea, Yoon, said, “Their two countries have agreed to immediate bilateral presidential consultations in the event of North Korea’s nuclear attack and promised to respond swiftly, overwhelmingly and decisively using the full force of the alliance, including the United States’ nuclear weapons.”
