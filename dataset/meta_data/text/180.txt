Tuesday, November 8, 2022 – The state media of North Korea reported that North Korea said it has never had arms dealing with Russia and does not plan to do so. This report came after the United States said North Korea is supplying artillery shells to Russia for its war in Ukraine.

Last week, the National Security Spokesperson of the White House, John Kirby, said the United States possesses information that suggests North Korea is supplying Russia with a “significant number of artillery shells.”

The Allegation was denied by the North Korean Defense Ministry officials, and said Pyongyang has “never had arms dealings with Russia and has no plan to do so in the future.”

North Korea was one of the only countries to recognize the independence of the breakaway Ukrainian region. It has since supported Russia’s proclaimed annexation of parts of Ukraine.
