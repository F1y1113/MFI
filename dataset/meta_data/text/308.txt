Thursday, August 24, 2023 – Yevgeny Prigozhin, a notable and influential mercenary in Russia, was on board a plane that crashed north of Moscow with no survivors. Neither the Kremlin nor the Defense Ministry commented on the fate of Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner mercenary group and a self-declared enemy of the army's leadership.

Grey Zone, a Telegram channel linked to Wagner, has pronounced him dead. They hailed him as a hero and patriot who it said had died in the hands of unidentified people called “traitors to Russia.”

The death of Prigozhin would also leave Wagner Group leaderless and raise questions about its future operations in Africa and other places. The executive jet that crashed, the Brazilian Embraer Legacy 600 model, has only recorded one accident in over 20 years of service.
