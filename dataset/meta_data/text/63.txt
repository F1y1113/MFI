Wednesday, May 18, 2022 - A flood from the torrential rainfall caused miners to be trapped in a Canadian-owned mine. Since the accident, A 24-hour-a-day rescue effort employing specialized equipment brought in from Ghana and South Africa has been underway.

It has taken about 4 weeks to reach the first rescue chambers that could be a point of refuge for the trapped miners. However, no miner was found in the chamber, located at about 560 meters from the surface.

Millions of liters of water have been pumped out of the mine. The rescue engineers have found it difficult to work in humid conditions to save their colleagues. All efforts are directed towards reaching the second refuge chamber, located at about 710 meters from the surface.

The minersâ€™ wives have gathered close to the area in prayer congregations, with tears and hopes that their husbands will be found alive.
