The increasing role of electricity as an energy carrier in decarbonising economies is driving a growing demand for electrical energy storage in the form of battery systems. Two battery applications driving demand growth are electric vehicles and stationary forms of energy storage. Consequently, established battery production networks are increasingly intersecting with – and being transformed by – actors and strategies in the transport and power sectors, in ways that are important to understand. Most analyses of battery production adopt a supply chain approach, focussing on the flow and transformation of materials from primary production via manufacturing to final assembly. They pay only limited attention to organisational and geographical relations, and they overlook critical areas of intersection between battery production and OEM manufacturing for automotive and power sectors. As a result, supply chain approaches do not fully account for emergent properties of battery production networks.

To remedy this, we deploy a global production network (GPN) approach that highlights the increasing intersection of battery manufacturing with the automotive and power sectors, informed by original research with key respondents in battery R&D and commercialization at the collaborative interfaces of academia, industry and government. Our GPN approach augments conventional supply chain accounts based on battery manufacturing in two ways: it identifies the economic and non-economic actors, network relations and multiple locations that constitute the global battery production network; and focuses on firm strategies of innovation, cooperation and competition through which this network acquires its organisationally and geographically dynamic character, (specifically increasing inter-industry intersections), and the multifaceted role of the state. The paper concludes by reflecting on the implications of this alternative account for understanding key areas of policy concern, and for analyses of the geopolitical economy of energy system transformation.

A large literature on battery mineral supply chains traces sequential processes of material transformation and trade associated with battery production. A primary focus of this work are the ‘upstream’ implications of battery manufacturing for supply and demand dynamics in mineral raw materials (see for example [3], [4], [5]). Research includes (dynamic) material flow analyses ([78], [79], [80], [81]), analyses of trade structures ([21], [82], [83], [84], [85]), supply risk [86] and mineral life cycles, including the battery R&D life cycle [87]. Supply chain analyses of the battery sector highlight the direct, indirect and hidden material flows associated with total material requirements of a global energy transition [88], and the dynamic interactions between renewable power generation, electricity grids and battery storage [89]. A technical literature on the evolution of battery technology supplements these material analyses, exploring state-of-the-art battery technologies, post-Li and non-LiBs, and technology development and R&D needs in the context of barriers for wider deployment [26]. Some of this work highlights research gaps around organisational and geographical aspects of the supply chain: research on battery patents, for example, notes a need for “a disaggregation of the GVC [Global Value Chain] and a deep knowledge of its various components and technologies” [90], and how its consequences for knowledge and innovation mean that “sectoral configuration…deserves more attention” [91], [92], [93], [94].

A broader set of studies seek to contextualize upstream or downstream elements of the battery supply chain. Upstream, a growing body of work considers the contribution of battery mineral production to equitable forms of resource-based development. Cohen and Riofrancos [95], for example, consider the role of lithium extraction in relation to Latin America's Green (New) Deal, while several authors reflect on how battery mineral production reproduces ‘colonial’ relations of resource extraction that overlook indigenous knowledge [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101]. Downstream, research focuses on demand arising from battery applications in electric mobility, especially EVs [102], [103], and includes work on demand reduction strategies [104], [105], [106] and circular strategies to reduce raw material reliance. The latter includes design for reuse and recycling [107], circular business models and supporting policy [108], [109], [110], cascading secondary uses that extend batteries beyond end-of-life in their first use, and recycling.

Framed as a supply chain, research on battery production also engages with potential geopolitical issues arising from bottlenecks in supply and import dependence around ‘critical’ raw materials [59], [113], [122], [123], [124], [125], [126]. Some of this work is geological or geometallurgical in nature [127], [128] while other studies consider environmental, climate and ethical implications of mineral supply chains [76], [129] including accounts of public investment in battery (gigafactory) infrastructure [66], conflict minerals [130] and options for more responsible sourcing [131], [132], [133]. There are now several detailed empirical studies addressing information gaps in relation to responsible sourcing of mineral based materials [134], [135], regional competitiveness [136], including studies which map the battery mineral supply chain, policy, lead actors and market volumes in national and international contexts.

Stepping back, the work we have briefly reviewed shows how decarbonisation, electrification and growing demand for energy storage will augment total material demand even while fossil fuel use may decline [1], [2].25 Mineral-based materials have a central role in emerging low-carbon supply chains [141], [142], [143], [144], [145], [146]. Projections of sharp mineral material demand create security of supply concerns and provoke geopolitical competition for the control over parts of mineral supply chains [147], [148], [149]. China's dominant market share in refining mineral products - and the country’s efforts to offset raw material supply risks by investing in overseas sources of supply (see [150]) have raised concern about resource availability. There are now policy initiatives in the US and the EU focussed explicitly on battery minerals alongside other materials for a low carbon energy transition, that aim to create alternative supply chains and establish technological advantage.

States are also adapting regulation around mineral occurrences and ownership of mineral reserves to regionalize battery production and pre-cursor battery materials (Table 6). Indonesia, for example, banned nickel ore exports in early 2020, and acquired shares in mineral-material production with the long-term aim of EV production.43 A consortium of four state-owned firms - the Indonesia Battery Corporation (IBC) – has been established to guide co-operation between battery developers and investors, following LG’s announcement of developing an integrated battery industry in Indonesia.44 IBC will invest in nickel mines, smelters, and associated upstream industries, and act as a major (51%) shareholder in the upstream EV battery sector. In a similar way Finland is building on its existing mining industry (Terrafame, Keliber) as both the largest nickel producer in the EU and the only EU member state with industrial scale cobalt production [197]. Government initiatives have also been unfolding around lithium occurrences (e.g. in Chile and Western Australia) - as states seek to generate additional value from mineral processing and other downstream activities (Table 6). The Biden Administration’s use of the US Defense Production Act to support domestic production and processing of the minerals and materials used for large capacity batteries – including lithium, graphite, cobalt, manganese and nickel - is further evidence of how states are using a range of governmental powers to promote domestic upstream activity and shorten battery supply chains.

Current policy approaches to energy transition imply very significant increases in demand for minerals and mineral-based materials, of which mobile and stationary forms of energy storage account for the lion’s share.58 A net-zero target consistent with 1.5 degrees may require a five to six-fold increase in annual base metal production by 2050 (e.g. copper, nickel, aluminium), with demand for lithium projected to grow to over 100-times its current level under such a scenario [215], [186]. Caveats and uncertainties necessarily attend projections like these, not least because such rapid increases in demand are likely to tighten markets for existing battery minerals (like nickel), propelling shifts towards other battery chemistries such as LFP and manganese-rich cathodes [186]. Nonetheless, it is clear that growing demand for electrical energy storage is producing new transnational economies of battery production, as firms, states and other actors compete and co-operate in the creation, transformation and capture of value via energy storage. The relations and dynamics that make up these transnational economies are not well understood and, importantly, go beyond issues of material flow. The multiple stages of production and assembly involved in battery production may be geographically dispersed and linked by material flows, yet they are also organisationally integrated across multiple (and often competing) states in ways that need to be better understood.

We have sought in this paper to demonstrate how a GPN approach to LiB production can augment conventional supply chain accounts of battery manufacturing. We have highlighted two primary insights: the role of economic and non-economic actors, network relations and multiple locations that constitute the global battery production network; and the strategies of innovation, cooperation and competition through which this network acquires its organisationally and geographically dynamic character. GPN can show, for example, how in Europe government incentives to regionalise supply chains, transboundary investment (both within and into the EU), and organisational strategies of vertical integration are driving new geographies of battery production at a range of scales (e.g. the ‘Baltic Belt’). Through a GPN approach, then, we have highlighted a structuring tension currently shaping battery production networks between, on the one hand, continued efforts to reduce cost which drives a form of ‘globalization’; and, on the other, efforts by states to regionalise and localise supply chains. The latter, however, are constrained by existing geographies of production, so that securing domestic supply chains (e.g. building a ‘British’ battery) frequently involves both inward investment by specialist suppliers and cross-border trade (e.g. importing materials and components, and securing export markets). In short, the tension between globalizing and localising supply chains, and how this tension is mediated by existing geographies of production, drives the configuration of the LiB production network.

We have shown how battery production has become increasingly tied to the strategies of automotive OEMs. Automakers' investment decisions, their performance requirements and the contracts they conclude with material suppliers are increasingly shaping battery production networks. EV mandates, and municipal and state decarbonisation strategies more generally, have spurred battery demand and created an organisational environment in which automotive companies increasingly occupy the lead firm position in battery production networks. The scale economies now available in battery production for the EV market, together with the sunk costs of gigafactory investments, create a material momentum in supply that means many non-EV battery uses (from the nascent aircraft market to diverse ESS applications) are currently derivative of EV. But we have also shown how automakers are collectively experimenting with organisational strategies that consolidate their role in the network by, for example, augmenting supply contracts with collaborative joint ventures and strategies of vertical integration. In addition, we have shown how the organisational structure of the battery production network increasingly extends downstream, via business models that offer energy storage as a service, and recycling and extended producer responsibility initiatives. Some of these organisational models redefine ownership at the level of minerals, while others centre on the combined qualities of minerals and mineral-based materials in the form of a battery. Here the evolution of value capture strategies around batteries, from a product offer to a service, aligns with increasing concerns about access to minerals and governance of their environmental and social impacts (as reflected, for example, in the anticipated EU Battery Regulation).

To conclude, this paper has demonstrated the value of a GPN approach for understanding the geopolitical economy of energy system transformation. GPN has been successfully applied to other energy sectors, but until now there has been no systematic effort to think through the organisational and geographical structures of LiB production. As economies decarbonise, and renewables replace fossil fuels in energy systems in ways that significantly expand demand for minerals, new production networks are emerging that intersect with and disrupt established networks. Understanding these intersections, and their implications (for scaling up non-fossil energy systems, for geographies of economic development etc) is increasingly important. At the same time, production networks associated with the new energy economy are distinctive in ways that potentially challenge existing GPN analyses. The cost of the battery means EV manufacturing networks are qualitatively different to those associated with producing petrol or diesel cars; and, for the most part, battery minerals are not consumed in use (like the bulk of oil and gas) but can be recovered and used again, opening up novel value capture possibilities downstream. In short, the application of GPN to understand the geopolitical economy of energy system transformation can be a mutually rewarding agenda.
