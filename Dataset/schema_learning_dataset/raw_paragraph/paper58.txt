Battery raw materials (cobalt, lithium, graphite, and nickel) are essential for a technologically-advanced low-carbon society. Most of these commodities are produced in just a few countries, which leads to supply risk as well as environmental and ethical issues. Finland, with its available mineral resources (deposits and mines), industry (metallurgy, refining) and technical expertise (know-how, automation), has the ideal ecosystem to tackle the challenge of improving the rechargeable battery raw materials supply chain and securing sustainable sources for Europe. The profitable extraction of these commodities in a competitive market is a complex function of key ore properties that drive extraction process performance and are directly linked to deposit geology and ore mineralogy. Hence, geometallurgy - which combines geological and metallurgical information to improve resource management, optimise extraction, and reduce technical risks - is the key multidisciplinary approach to tackling the challenge of sustainable and responsible EU domestic production of battery raw materials.

Finland, with its available mineral resources (battery mineral deposits and operating mines), metallurgical industry (processing plants, smelters, refineries), and its technical expertise (know-how, automation, low-price clean energy), has the ideal ecosystem to tackle the challenge of improving the battery raw materials supply chain and securing a sustainable, conflict-free, source for Europe.
