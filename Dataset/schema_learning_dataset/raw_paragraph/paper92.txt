The most critical phases of the life cycle of lithium-ion batteries are managed in a few countries. The DRC and Chile  are the main providers of cobalt and lithium, respectively. China is the main provider of synthetic and natural graphite, refined cobalt, as well as lithium-ion cells and batteries. South Korea is leading in battery recycling, but some OEMs are putting in place their own recycling. On the raw material extraction side, the European Commission designated cobalt, lithium, graphite, and nickel as critical raw materials for battery production, urging for a sustainable supply chain, improved cell performance and durability, and recycling technology innovation.
