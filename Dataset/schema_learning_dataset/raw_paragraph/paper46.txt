In response to the research context described above, this paper provides insights into a multi-tiered supply chain case study that focuses on a niche EV manufacturer, referred to as EV-Co (the company's name has been changed to preserve its anonymity).

This case study also encompasses the EV manufacturer's suppliers of those drivetrainrelated components that most distinguish the EV from an ICE vehicle (e.g. motor, battery, fuel cells, and electronic control units). The identity of these suppliers is also disguised to preserve their anonymity.

EV-Co plans to move from producing five units to 30,000 units within five years. As a relatively new start-up company, EV-Co will be highly dependent upon its suppliers to achieve quick volume ramp-up and all-round improved operational and supply chain performance, in order to be able to overcome their resource deficiencies and the risks associated with expansion. To compound their relatively weak position in the supply
chain, EV-Co presently accounts for a very low average proportion (about 10%) of their suppliers' sales/revenue; this gives EV-Co very little relative buying power. This study, in part, adds much-needed insight into how buyer dependence on suppliers (Kähkönen et al., 2015) during production ramp-up can be better managed. This study explores and attempts to explain strategies to positively develop supply chain relationships/dependencies during production ramp-up activities, based on specific contingency factors. Thus, there are two specific questions that drive this research:
