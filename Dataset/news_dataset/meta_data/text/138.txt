Monday, September 12, 2022 â€“ The tension around a breakdown in talks between Iran and the US over Tehran's nuclear program escalated when the minister for the defense of Israel, Benny Gantz, gave a clear warning on the capability of Iran to produce enough enriched uranium to make three nuclear warheads in few weeks.

The United Nation's nuclear inspectorate chief, Rafael Grossi, at the same time said it would be tough to restore the knowledge his organization had lost concerning the nuclear activities of Iran, given that his inspectors and cameras have been barred from key sites by Iran.

A statement was issued by France, Germany, and the United Kingdom over the weekend saying they could no longer offer concessions in the revival talks. They also added that "Iran's latest demand raises serious doubts about Iran's intentions and commitment to a successful outcome on the talks."
