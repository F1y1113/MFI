Monday, September 19, 2022 – Emergency authorities in the west African nation of Nigeria confirmed the death of 300 people as a result of a flood in 2022. The flood was reported to be Nigeria’s worst flooding in a decade which affected 27 of the 36 states.

According to the Nigerian National Emergency Management Agency, approximately 100,000 people have been displaced by the floods and more than 500 people were injured from the disaster. Crops, farmlands, and infrastructure have been destroyed in many of the flooded areas, especially the northern region which is responsible for most of the farming that occurs in Nigeria.

Flooding in Nigeria is annual, however, most of it has been attributed to a lack of infrastructure, and failure to implement safe environmental guidelines.

More flood was expected this year due to the increased amount of rainfall throughout the country; due to this, the disaster management agency has sent a preparatory warning to many states of possible consequences before the year runs out.
