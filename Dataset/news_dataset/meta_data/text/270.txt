Monday, June 19, 2023 – Italy has moved to block a Chinese state-owned company from taking over Pirelli, a renowned tire-making industry. The decision by the Italian government is part of measures to protect the independence of Pirelli.

In a statement, Pirelli said to investors that the government of Italy had ruled that only Camfin, a company which is controlled by Pirelli’s boss, Marco Tronchetti Provera, has the authority to nominate candidates to be its chief executive.

The agreement was examined by the administration of the Italian Prime Minister under the “Golden Power Procedure” rules. The rule aims to protect the business reviewed as strategically important to the nation.

Pirelli was sold for €7.1bn ($7.8bn) in 2015 to a group of investors, including ChemChina and Camfin. ChemChina merged with state-owned Sinochem six years later.
