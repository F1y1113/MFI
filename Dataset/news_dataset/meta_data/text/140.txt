Friday, September 16, 2022 – The Ministry of Defense in Ukraine in a Twitter post on Friday, said Ukrainian authorities have found 440 unmarked graves at a burial site in Izium, a city in the eastern part of Ukraine recently recaptured from Russian forces. 

Volodymyr Zelensky said the Ukrainian and international journalists would be shown the site to see what had been uncovered. He also added that they “want the world to know what is really happening and what the Russian occupation has led to.”

The Center for Strategic Communications in Ukraine said some of the graves that were discovered in Izium were fresh, and that civilians constitute the highest number of the people buried there.

In April, Izium was subjected to intense artillery attacks from Russia, and the city, which is located near the border between the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, became a crucial hub for the invading military during five months of occupation.
