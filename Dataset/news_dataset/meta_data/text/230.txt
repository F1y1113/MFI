Tuesday, March 14, 2023 – The details of the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia’s plan to create a new fleet of nuclear-powered submarines have been unveiled, aimed at countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Under the AUKUS pact, the United States will provide Australia with its first-ever nuclear-power subs.

President of the United States, Joe Biden, said the deal aims to bring peace to the region. He also emphasized that the subs would be nuclear-powered and not nuclear-armed.

The deal is a major upgrade to the Australian military, with them being just the second country after the United Kingdom to receive Washington’s elite nuclear propulsion technology. The sailors in the Australian navy will be sent to U.S. and U.K. submarine bases to receive training on how to use the nuclear-powered submarines.
