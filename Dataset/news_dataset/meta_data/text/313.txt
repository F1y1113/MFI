Wednesday, September 13, 2023 – Ukraine has confirmed that it was responsible for the attack on naval targets and port infrastructure in Crimea. It is described as one of its biggest strikes on the Russian navy’s Black Sea fleet.  Earlier on, Russia claimed that 10 missiles were launched by Ukraine, which caused a large fire at a Sevastopol shipyard, leaving 24 people injured.

An official in the Ukrainian military intelligence, Andriy Yusov confirmed that “a large landing vessel and submarine were hit. However, they do not comment on the means of the strike." The head of Ukraine’s air force via a Telegram post thanked his pilots for their excellent combat work, which strongly suggests that the weaponry was launched by Ukrainian aircraft.

Russia’s Ministry of Defense however confirmed that both vessels will be fully repaired and continued in normal service.
