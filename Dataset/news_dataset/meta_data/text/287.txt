Monday, July 3, 2023 – Kyiv’s domestic intelligence agency confirmed that the authorities had charged former top security officials in Ukraine with treason. The move is aimed at identifying Russia’s spies within.

Oleh Kulinich, the former head of the Security Service of Ukraine’s (SBU) Crimea directorate, was arrested last July on the charges that he required other Russian-friendly operatives on orders from Russia. If Kulinich is convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison.

The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, praised the arrest of Kulinich last year and termed it a process of self-purification. The former SBU chief, Ivan Bakanov, was also sacked by Zelenskiy. 

Authorities are also investigating a former head of the SUB’s Department of internal security, Andriy Naumov, who arrived in Serbia last year with a car full of cash and emeralds.
