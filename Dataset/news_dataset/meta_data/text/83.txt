Thursday, June 9, 2022 - US-based scientist Dr. Mike McPhaden met with colleagues in Australia and gave a public session on the current state of the Pacific and what it means for months ahead in Sydney this week.

Scientists and meteorologists are fixated on a particular part of the tropical Pacific Ocean known as Nino 3.4, where the surface temperatures are used to determine the occurrence of either El Nino or La Nina. 

El Ni√±os are associated with above-average temperatures in the tropical Pacific. They tend to bring hotter and drier weather to Australia's east coast. La Ninas are connected to below-average temperatures in that ocean region. They are associated with greater rainfall and lower temperatures. 

According to McPhaden, triple La Ninas are very rare, with the last one occurring more than 20 years ago. If the coming storm is a triple La Nina, it has the potential to continue into 2023. He also said that global heating plays a role in the current weather events. However, scientists are still trying to understand how the climate could affect the events and activities of the storm.
