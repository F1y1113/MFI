On January 14, the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano in Tonga erupted, blasting ash into the atmosphere and causing tsunamis across the Pacific. The eruption lasted for twelve hours, and sent waves as far away as Peru and the United States. The full extent of damage in Tonga is yet unknown, as the eruption damaged cables the country relies on for telecommunications. There are confirmed casualties in Tonga and in Peru.
