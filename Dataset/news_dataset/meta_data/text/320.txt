Monday, September 11, 2023 â€“ Due to hazard reduction burns over the weekend, Sydney awoke on Monday to a thick layer of smoke covering several areas of the city.

 The commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said firefighters will continue performing hazard reduction burns over the upcoming few months as long as it's safe to do so, which might cause smoke to become trapped in the Sydney basin.

The Hazard reduction burn is a yearly practice by the firefighters especially in areas where there are properties. The fire service chiefs informed local news that the hazard burns were delayed this year and the process is still currently behind schedule.

Communities are being urged to bear with the process because; ultimately the smoke will clear over a period of few days and is far better than a bushfire disaster which could easily get out of control.
