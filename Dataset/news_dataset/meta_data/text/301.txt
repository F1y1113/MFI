Friday, August 4, 2023 - The government of China has announced that it would relax its rules on internal migration. This will allow people to settle in small cities to boost their economy and promote growth. 

The Ministry of Public Security (MPS) announced plans to reduce the requirement for obtaining an urban hukou, or household registration. The ministry directed Local governments to cancel hukou restrictions in cities with fewer than 3 million people and to relax the restrictions for cities with 3-5 million people. Hukou policies have been decentralized since the 1990s. This allows local governments to set their own rules about registering new citizens.

The deputy director of the Ministry of Public Security, He Wenlin, confirmed that the government wants the new measure to be implemented by the end of the month.
