Sunday, July 17, 2022 – Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy abruptly fired the head of Ukraine’s powerful domestic security agency, the SBU. The state prosecutor general says there are a great number of cases of collaboration with Russia by officials in their agencies. 

The Executive Order, which was released on Friday, saw the abrupt sackings of SBU chief Ivan Bakanov, Zelenskiy’s childhood friend, and the prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, who played a key role in the prosecution of Russian war crimes. It was announced on the President’s website.

He said over 60 officials from Venediktova and Bakanov’s agencies have started working against Ukraine in Russian-occupied territories, and 651 alleged treason cases and collaborations have been opened against prosecutorial and law enforcement officials.

Zalenskiy said, “Such an array of crimes against the foundations of the national security of the state pose very serious questions to the leaders,” and vowed that every question will receive a proper answer.
