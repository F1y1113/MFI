Thursday, June 15, 2023 â€“ Global temperatures surged to record-high levels this month, a worrying indicator of the impending climate crisis. Global average temperatures for June are roughly 1C higher than averages for the same month going back to 1979. 

Although the month is not yet over and may not break the June record, according to climate scientists, it continues a trend of intensifying global warming that may make this year the warmest on record, surpassing 2016. This year, from Puerto Rico to Siberia to Spain, has already seen catastrophic, record heatwaves wreak havoc, and last week, poisonous smoke from massive wildfires in Canada obscured the skies above New York City and Washington.

While individuals are experiencing the heat on land, the seas are experiencing an even more extraordinary surge of warmth, with a second straight month of record-high ocean surface temperatures. This affects overall world temperatures, warps fish populations, bleaches coral reefs and causes sea level rise along the shore.
