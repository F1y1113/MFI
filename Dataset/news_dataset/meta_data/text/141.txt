The stocks of the United Kingdom also dropped after chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng outlined a series of tax cuts and economic measures in a massive shake-up of the country’s finances. 

Pounds drooped below $1.09 after falling more than 3% against the dollar. Recently, the pound sterling has fallen due to the worry about the economy, and partly due to the stronger US dollar. On Friday, the pound also fell more than 1% against the euro, which dropped to €1.09.
