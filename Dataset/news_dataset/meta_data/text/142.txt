Saturday, September 24, 2022 – The United States has been accused by China of sending “very wrong, dangerous signals” to Taiwan after the secretary of state of the United State told his Chinese counterpart that maintenance of peace and stability over Taiwan was vitally important.

US officials told reporters that, the focus of the 90-minute, direct and honest talks between the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, was Taiwan, their discussion was on the margins of the UN general assembly in New York.

The Foreign Ministry of China said in a statement on the meeting that United States was sending a very wrong dangerous signal to Taiwan, and warned that the more rampant Taiwan’s independence activity, the less likely there would be a peaceful settlement.

Chinese Foreign ministry tagged the Taiwan issue as an “Internal Chinese matter”, and said the United States has no right to interfere in the method used to resolve it.
