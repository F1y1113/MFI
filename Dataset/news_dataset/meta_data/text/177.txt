Saturday, November 5, 2022 – A law has been signed by the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, to conscript citizens with unexpunged or outstanding convictions for murder, robbery, larceny, drug trafficking, and other serious crimes under the Criminal Code of Conduct of the Russian Federation to be called up for military service to mobilize.

This law makes it possible to have hundreds of thousands of people mobilized. These people have been sentenced to probation or have recently been released from colonies that were previously forbidden to serve.

President Putin confirmed that an additional 18,000 soldiers have already been mobilized by Kremlin, above its goal of 300,000 to fight in the war in Ukraine from the general male population substances.

Though the Russian military earlier this week announced that all partial mobilization activities had been suspended, Putin’s partial mobilization order will only end when the President signs an official decree.
