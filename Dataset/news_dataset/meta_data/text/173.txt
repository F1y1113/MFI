Saturday, October 29, 2022 â€“ The Russian Minister for Defence announced that it would suspend its participation in the brokered grain export deal of the United Nations with Ukraine after the Crimean city of Sevastopol was attacked by a drone. Though the report from Russia cannot be independently verified, Russia blames Kyiv for the attacks.

On Saturday, Russia was accused by a top Ukrainian official of inventing "fictitious terrorist attacks" on its facilities in Crimea, and Moscow is also accused of blackmail. In a telegram post, the head Ukrainian President's office, Andrii Yerma, blames Russia for "nuclear blackmail, energy blackmail, and food blackmail."

In July, Ministers from Ukraine and Russia signed an agreement brokered by the United Nations and Turkey following months of negotiations. Russia promised to unblock the Black Sea's port to allow the safe passage of grain and oilseeds, some of the most important exports of Ukraine.
