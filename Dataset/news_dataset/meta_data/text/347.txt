Friday, October 13, 2023 – Following the attack on Israel by Hamas militants, the Gaza Strip has seen a series of bombardments with bombs from Israel in a crisis that has grown to become a full-blown war. The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu mentioned in an earlier report that “Gaza will be placed under a total blockade from food, water, fuel and electricity supply”.

As the crisis continues, Gaza is reportedly running out of fuel to power the generators that supply electricity to the only healthcare facilities left, and more than 50,000 pregnant women cannot access health services. The people of Gaza — about 1.1 million of them including women and children — have been instructed to move further south to avoid the Israeli bombardment against Hamas, and the blockade will not stop until Hamas releases the captured Israeli Hostages.

Since the beginning of the crisis over the past few days, 1,300 Israelis have died with Hamas holding about 150 hostages; retaliatory attacks from Israel have led to the death of 1,500 Palestinians, 338,000 people displaced, 19 healthcare facilities grounded 11 health workers killed, and 16 of them mortally wounded.
