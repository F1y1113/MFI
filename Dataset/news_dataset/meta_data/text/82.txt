Wednesday, June 29, 2022 – NATO will strengthen its military presence across Europe in reaction to the War between Russia and Ukraine. New US warships will be deployed to Spain, fighters to the UK, and ground soldiers to Romania.

NATO leader Jens Stoltenberg says the organization is undergoing its largest revamp since the Cold War. In reaction to the war, more than 300,000 troops will be on high readiness alert next year, up from the current 40,000.

The US will strengthen its presence across the continent, especially in eastern Europe, where its 5th Army Corps will be headquartered. Biden said NATO is “needed more than ever, and we mean it when we say an attack on one is an attack against all.”

The Russian Federation is the biggest danger to partners’ security and Euro-Atlantic peace and stability, according to NATO.
