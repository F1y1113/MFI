Friday, May 27, 2022 - Russian businessman Andrey Melnichenko handed over ownership of two of the world's largest coal and Fertilizer companies to his wife the day before he was sanctioned by the European Union, according to reports.

The legal filings reviewed before March 8 show that Melnichenko was the owner of the two companies through a chain of trusts and corporations stretching from Moscow and the Swiss Town of Zug to Cyprus and Bermuda.

When Russia's invasion of Ukraine began in February, Melnichenko was concerned he would be identified under the European Union's Russia sanction regime. Melnichenko notified trustees of his retirement as the beneficiary and made his wife the beneficiary. 

Melnichenko, with an estimated fortune of $18 billion, was ranked as Russia's eighth richest man last year by Forbes.
