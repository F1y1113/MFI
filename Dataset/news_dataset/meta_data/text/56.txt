Thursday, May 12, 2022 - North Korea, since the start of the pandemic, has shut its borders to visitors and humanitarian aid. However, news sources said areas of Pyongyang had been locked down for two days following the news of an outbreak. Citizens have reportedly resorted to panic buying.

The Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-Un, has called a crisis meeting to preside over the ensuing trend. Health Officials and front-line workers have been deployed with tests carried out on the suspected patients. Results from the tests are in line with the Omicron variant according to North Korean State Media – KNCA.

Kim told the Workers party Politburo that “the goal was to eliminate the root within the shortest time.” Consequently, there has been tighter control at the borders and on the movement of citizens. Production activities now occur in Isolation to prevent spread.

Despite the outbreak, there are no signs that the country is ready to open up to the world.
