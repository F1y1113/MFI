Friday, May 19, 2023 – The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, is set to travel to Japan for the Group of Seven (G7) summit in person. This is seen as a display of confidence and Western solidarity from Ukraine’s president as he attempts to maintain important alliances with other nations.

The trip will be the first Ukrainian President’s trip to Asia since the invasion of Ukraine last year in February. The war in Ukraine is already at the top of the agenda of the three-day G7 summit, where leaders from the world’s wealthiest democracies are expected to support Ukraine.

Oleksii Danilov, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, said the physical presence of Ukraine’s president is very crucial to defend the country’s interests and also providing clear proposals and clear arguments on the events that are happening in the country.
