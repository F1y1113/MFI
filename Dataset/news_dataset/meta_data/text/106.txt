Wednesday, July 6, 2022 – The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack on a Nigerian Prison where about 440 inmates have escaped.

During the attack, a security officer and three more were injured as suspected Boko Haram insurgents came to free their members who were held in the medium-security prison.

According to the prison service, 879 inmates fled the facility, 443 of them are still at large, four inmates died, and 16 more were injured.

President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria visited the prison. He emphasized that the attack was unacceptable and questioned the prison’s security system. He has alerted the security agencies to come up with a report and begin investigations. In a separate attack, the convoy of the President was also ambushed on his way to Daura, his hometown, for the Islamic festivals.

These attacks further show the security challenges that have plagued the country, spreading and growing from the northern regions.
