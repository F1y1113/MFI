Sunday, October 16, 2022 - During the opening of a major party meeting on Sunday, China's President, Xi Jinping, said it is up to the people of China to resolve the Taiwan issue, and China will never renounce the right to use force but will strive for a peaceful resolution.

Taiwan, which China sees as its territory, responded that it would not give up on its sovereignty or compromise on freedom and democracy.

The tension between Beijing and Taipei rose in August after China staged war games near Taiwan following the visit of United State House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. There is still a continuation of military activities, though at a reduced pace.

While speaking at the ruling Communist Party's 20th party congress in Beijing, Xi said, "they insist on striving for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and best efforts, but they will never promise to give up the use of force and reserve the option to take all necessary measures.
