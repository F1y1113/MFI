Saturday, May 13, 2023 – The United States and the European Union will pledge joint action to look into concerns about China concerning non-market practices and coordinate their export controls on semiconductors and other goods at a meeting later this month.

Secretary of State of the United States, Antony Blinken, Vice-President of the European Commission, Margarethe Vestager, and other senior officials are expected to meet in Lulea, Sweden, on May 30-31. The meeting will be the fourth edition of the EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council (TTC).

They also plan to coordinate their controls on sensitive items, including goods with military use and semiconductors. Also, part of their aim is to cooperate to counter foreign manipulation of information, including “China’s amplification of Russian disinformation narratives about the war in Ukraine.”
