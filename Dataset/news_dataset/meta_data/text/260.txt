Monday, May 8, 2023 — Russia launched fresh waves of drones and missile strikes on Ukraine. Explosions were heard in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, overnight. The mayor confirmed that five people had been injured in what he described as the most significant kamikaze drone attack so far.

Ukrainian military confirmed that the latest attack by Russia was launched shortly after midnight and lasted for over four hours. Iranian-made Shahed kamikaze drones were seen all across the country. The Mayor of Kyiv, Vitaliy Klitschko, said close to 60 drones were launched by Russia, which makes it the most significant attack of such.

The military administration of Kyiv said emergency services responded after wreckages of drones fell on a runway at Khuliany international airport, which is one of the city’s two commercial airports. The President of Ukraine announced that May 9 would be celebrated as Europe Day.
