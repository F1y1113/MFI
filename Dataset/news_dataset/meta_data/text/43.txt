GM has signed a multi-year sourcing agreement for the supply of cobalt from Glencore’s mining operation in Australia. Both are members of the Responsible Minerals Initiative

Cobalt is an important metal in the production of EV batteries. The material processed from Australia will be used in GM’s Ultium battery cathodes, which will support models such as the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac LYRIQ.  

“GM and our suppliers are building an EV ecosystem that is focused on sourcing critical raw materials in a secure sustainable manner,” said Jeff Morrison, GM vice president, Global Purchasing and Supply Chain. “Importantly, given the critical role of EVs in reducing the carbon footprint of the transportation sector, this agreement is aligned with our approach to responsible sourcing and supply chain management.”
