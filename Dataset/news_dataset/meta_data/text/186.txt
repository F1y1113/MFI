Thursday, November 24, 2022 – According to the estimates, well over 20,000 people died throughout Western Europe during this summer's heatwaves. The analysis revealed a disparity between the number of fatalities that occurred and those predicted based on previous trends.

During the summer heatwaves, temperatures in London hit 40°C, parts in south-west France reached 42°C, while Seville and Córdoba in Spain established records of 44°C. According to the EU's Copernicus climate change program, the summer of 2022 was the warmest on record.

Although the research did not precisely quantify heat-related mortality, the number of deaths was greater on average for heat-period days than for non-heat-period days.

"Heatwaves are growing more common and powerful as the world warms up, so we may expect more and hotter heatwaves in the future," said Dr. Eunice Lo, a research fellow in climate change and health at the University of Bristol.
