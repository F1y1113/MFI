Friday, August 25, 2023 – Coup leaders in Niger have given the French ambassador 48 hours to leave the country amid the continuous deterioration of the bilateral ties between France and Niger. The Junta confirmed that Sylvain Itte refused to respond to a meeting with the foreign minister of Niger. France, however, said the junta had no authority to order such an expulsion. 

According to the French foreign ministry, they said “the putschists do not have the authority to make this request, the ambassador’s approval coming solely from the legitimate elected Nigerien authorities.

Last week, the coup's leader, Gen Abdourahamane Tchiani, promised to return control of the country to the civilian within three years. The announcement was made during a meeting between the General and mediators from the West African regional bloc ECOWAS in Niamey's capital.
