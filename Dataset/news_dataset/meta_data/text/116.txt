Monday, July 25, 2022 - The Ukrainian government, with the goal of easing global food shortages, has proceeded with efforts to restart grain exports from its Black Sea ports, but gave a clear warning that if the Russian missile that struck in Odesa was a sign of more to come, deliveries would suffer. 

Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, denounced Saturday's attack as "barbaric", which shows that Moscow could not be trusted with the implementation of a deal that was struck a day earlier with Turkish and United Nations mediation. 

The minister for infrastructure, Oleksandr Kubrakov, said in a Facebook post that "We continue technical preparations for the launch of exports of agricultural products from our ports." 

On Friday, Moscow and Kyiv signed a deal that was hailed as a diplomatic breakthrough that would help bring down the soaring global food prices by restoring Ukrainian grain shipments to pre-war levels of 5 million tonnes a month.
