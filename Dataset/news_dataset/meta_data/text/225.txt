Thursday, February 16, 2023 â€“ 10 days following multiple earthquakes along the border of Turkiye and Syria, emergency services continue to rescue people from under the rubble. So far, the death toll after 10 days stands at 42,000.

Most people blamed poor construction standards for the massive death toll, and some even mentioned that the actual number of fatalities exceeded official figures. More than 100 developers and builders have been arrested in Turkey, but the officials authorized the construction have escaped.

The UN has launched separate appeals for Turkiye and Syria separately, amounting to $1bn and $400m, respectively, as relief funds. In both countries, more than 1 million people have been displaced, with NATO commenting on the Turkish disaster as one of the most devastating natural disasters ever on NATO soil.
