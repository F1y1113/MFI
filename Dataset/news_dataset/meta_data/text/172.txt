Wednesday, October 26, 2022 - There were accusations against the Chinese government for establishing at least two undeclared "police stations" in the Netherlands. A spokesperson for the Dutch foreign ministry confirmed that the existence of the unofficial police outposts was illegal.

Dutch media got hold of evidence that the "overseas service station" which promised diplomatic services is being used to try to silence dissidents of China in Europe. The foreign ministry of China has rejected the allegations of the Dutch.

A Spain-based NGO launched an investigation after a report entitled Chinese Transnational Policing Gone Wild. According to the organization, 54 overseas police service centers have been established by the public security bureaus from two Chinese provinces across five continents and 21 countries. Most of the established police services are in Europe, including nine in Spain and four in Italy. Two were found in London and one in Glasgow in the United Kingdom.
