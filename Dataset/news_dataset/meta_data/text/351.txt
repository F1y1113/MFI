Saturday, November 11, 2023 – The director of a hospital in Gaza confirmed that Israeli tanks have surrounded the territory’s largest healthcare facility. Mustafa al-Kahlout, who heads the hospital in northern Gaza said that they were surrounded and asked for assistance from the Red Cross in evacuating.

A spokesperson of the World Health Organization said that al-Shifa was under serious Israeli strike, adding that 20 hospitals in the Gaza Strip were out of action. However, the Israeli military said that the attack on al-Shifa hospital was because of a misfired projectile that was launched from inside Gaza.

It is not clear what struck the hospital, but the videos seen show injured people lying on the ground of the outdoor clinic. Doctors Without Borders confirmed that they have lost contact with its staff inside Al-Shifa hospital.
