Saturday, August 5, 2023 – The former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, has been sentenced to three years in prison over corruption allegations. He was found guilty of not declaring the money he earned from selling gifts he received while he was in office.

Mr. Khan, a former cricket player before becoming a politician, was elected into office in 2018. He was, however, ousted last year with a vote of no confidence after falling out with Pakistan’s military.

Judge Humayun Dilawar wrote in his ruling that the dishonesty of the former Prime Minister had been established beyond doubt. The judge confirmed that the police had been instructed to immediately arrest Mr Khan.

The lawyer of Imran Khan, Intazar Hussain Panjutha, condemned the trial, saying the accused was not allowed to defend himself.
