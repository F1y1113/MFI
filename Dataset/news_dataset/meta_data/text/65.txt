Friday, May 27, 2022 - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Russian President, Vladimir Putin, is making slow but visible progress in the Donbas,  Eastern Ukraine.

Johnson expresses his fear that Putin continues to make progress in Donbas at a high cost to himself and the Russian military. 

The invasion launched by Russia on February 24 is called a "special military operation" to demoralize and "de-nazify its neighbor", but Ukraine and the West say these are false pretexts for a war of aggression.

Johnson said, "the only way there can be an end is for Putin to accept that the denazification of Ukraine has already been achieved, and withdrawing would be with dignity and honor." However, the prime minister clarified that his statement did not mean he supported Russia's premise that there were Nazis in Ukraine.
