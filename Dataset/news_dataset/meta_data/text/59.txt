Tuesday, May 17, 2022 - The bid of the Scandinavian countries of Sweden and Finland to join NATO, the largest military alliance in the world, can only be completed by a unanimous agreement by all current members of the organization.

Swedish and Finnish bids to join may be rejected as Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Turkey, opposed the move. He also added that the two countries should not send delegates with hopes of negotiation. 

Erdogan’s reason was that he cannot agree to the admission of countries that placed sanctions on Turkey. He also accused them of harboring the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which the Turkish state has viewed as a terrorist group since a 2016 coup attempt.

The Finnish foreign minister made it clear that Finland would not enter any form of negotiation with Turkey. The Swedish Prime minister said with the new reality in Europe, NATO will strengthen Sweden, and vice versa, to end an age-long military non-alignment.
