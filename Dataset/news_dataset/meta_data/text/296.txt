Wednesday, July 5, 2023 – The last few years have been a delicate period of serious conversations about climate change. Until the beginning of this week, the hottest day on record occurred in 2016, during the previous El Nio global weather event, when the worldwide average temperature reached 16.92 degrees Celsius. The El Niño, Phenomenon was confirmed to have returned by experts and, with it, high daily temperatures.
