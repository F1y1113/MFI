Tuesday, September 19, 2023 – There has been a tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsion from Canada and India concerning the allegation of the Prime Minister of Canada, that New Delhi was involved in a state-sponsored assassination on Canadian soil.

Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau while speaking on Tuesday stood very firm on his allegation that India was involved in the death of the Sikh independence advocate, Hardeep Singh Niijar, who was shot dead in Surrey, British Columbia in June.

Canada’s Foreign Ministry then expelled Pavan Kumar Rai the most senior member of India’s foreign intelligence agency operating in Canada. The authorities of India then retaliated, ordering a senior Canadian diplomat to leave the country within five days.

James Cleverly, British foreign secretary confirmed that the United Kingdom is in support of an investigation by Canada, and says he expects that India will cooperate.
