Tuesday, September 5, 2023 – Gabon’s military junta leader, General Brice Nguema, was sworn in by Gabon’s constitutional court as the interim president of the country. Gen. Brice led a coup that ousted the country’s president Ali Bongo last week, a coup which ended the Bongo family’s long reign in the country.

Before the coup on Wednesday, President Bongo, who has been the president for close to 14 years was declared winner of a controversial presidential election marred by voting delays and internet cuts. Celebration broke out in the country because of the coup, with lots of supporters expressing solidarity with the military.

Gen. Brice, who was Bongo’s former bodyguard was swiftly installed as the transitional leader. He approved the reopening of Gabon borders ahead of his swearing-in. He also met with political leaders to discuss reform and a possible transitional period.
