Saturday, September 3, 2022 â€“ China "warns" the U.S., saying it would take "countermeasures" after the Biden administration approved more than $1.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan.

Liu Pengyu, the spokesman of the Chinese embassy, said China firmly opposes the sales, which "severely jeopardize China-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait," and immediately calls Washington to revoke them. Liu's comments on Twitter came after the Biden administration notified Congress formally of the proposed sales.

The State Department said the sales are in line with a longstanding policy of the United States to provide defensive weapons to the island and described the "swift provision" of such arms as being essential for the security of Taiwan. However, China accuses the United States of interfering in what it describes as its internal affairs.

On Saturday, Taiwan thanked the United States government for "continuing to implement its security commitments to Taiwan and said it welcomes the latest arms sales.
