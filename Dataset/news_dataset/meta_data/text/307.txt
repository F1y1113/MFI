Monday, August 21, 2023 – Reports confirmed that a Ukrainian drone strike had destroyed a Russian long-range bomber. The images posted on social media show a Tupolev Tu-22 on fire at Soltsy-2 airbase, south of St. Petersburg. Russia has often used the Tu-22 — a supersonic war jet — to attack Ukrainian cities.

The Ministry of Defense of Russia confirmed that “an attack by a copter-type UAV took place around 10:00 Moscow time.” The ministry added, “The UAV was detected by the airfield’s observation outpost and was hit with small-arms fire.”

However, the destruction of just one aircraft in the Russian military has little effect on the potency of Moscow’s current 60-strong fleet. The operation, however, highlights that Kyiv’s ability to strike targets deep inside Russian territory is growing.
