Tuesday, April 18, 2023 – Kremlin confirms that the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, visited part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region controlled by Russia. He also visited the Luhansk region in Ukraine. Russia claimed to have annexed both regions, but they did not have full control.

While speaking with the military, Mr. Putin told them that although he doesn’t want to distract them from their duties, he feels “it is important for him to hear their opinion on how the situation is developing, to listen to them and to exchange information.”

In response to the reports of the visit of Mr Putin, an adviser to the office of Mr. Zelensky, Mykhailo Podolyak, tweeted that the Russian leader was touring the occupied and ruined territories of Ukraine to enjoy the crimes that his military had committed.
