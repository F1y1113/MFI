Tuesday, October 11, 2022 – The death Count in the West African nation of Nigeria has risen over the past few days due to flooding in different places in the country. In recent events, a boat conveying more than 80 people from the southeastern region of Anambra capsized, resulting in the death of the passengers.

According to the National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, more than 600,000 people have been displaced due to the floods. NEMA also reported that the floods were particularly high and dangerous this year because of the release of excess water from a dam in Cameroon, a neighboring southeast country to Nigeria.

Apart from the tragedy in Anambra State, floods in Kogi, Nigeria’s confluence state, were reported to be as high as Rooftops rendering people homeless and displacing thousands of others.

Humanitarian Bodies such as the Red Cross Society have deployed agents to complement the government's efforts across the Country.
