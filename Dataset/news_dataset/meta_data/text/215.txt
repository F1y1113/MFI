Saturday, January 14, 2023 â€” Since the start of December 2022, China has seen a continual large amount of death from the coronavirus infection. The surge began shortly after President Xi lifted the Zero-Covid Policy to allow for the movement of people for upcoming holidays.

The Head of the Bureau of Medical Administration stated in his account of events that most of those who died were over the age of 65 years and had underline conditions, while some of the victims died due to respiratory distress.

The reported death accounted for were those that occurred in the hospitals only, with worries that the actual number of casualties may be higher. This prompted several countries to issue mandatory testing for those coming from China.

Experts believe that the surge in death has peaked in most areas; however, with high travel schedules, the risk may increase significantly. Therefore, people have been advised to limit their visits to certain areas of the country.
