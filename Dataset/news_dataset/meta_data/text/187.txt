Friday, December 2, 2022 â€“ Russia says peace talks will be complicated due to the West's refusal to recognize new territories seized from Ukraine after the president of the United States indicated that he would be ready to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

The Kremlin made it clear that it was open to negotiations but will not be on the demand of the West to pull out of Ukraine. 

President Biden told reporters that he was ready to meet with the Russian leader if he was interested in putting an end to the war. Beside him in the White House was the President of France, Emmanuel Macron; both of whom had agreed not to urge the Ukrainians to make a compromise that would not be acceptable to them.
