Saturday, October 1, 2022 – Ukrainian troops liberated the key eastern city of Lyman as Russia suffered another military defeat, with videos that showed Ukrainian troops raising a blue and yellow national flag and performing a victory dance.

Russia’s ministry of defense acknowledged that its troops had retreated. Following their encirclement by Ukrainian forces, the ministry said: “they had been withdrawn to more advantageous lines.”

This came hours after Russia’s President, Vladimir Putin, declared on Friday that the city in the Donetsk region belonged to Russia forever. In a ceremony that was held in the Kremlin, he announced the province’s annexation alongside the territories of Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.

Ukraine’s armed forces said on Saturday that their troops had surrounded the city entirely, trapping thousands of Russian soldiers inside. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk province, said the besieged troops had pleaded to be allowed to leave Lyman.
