Wednesday, October 18, 2023 – Officials in Palestine have confirmed that hundreds were killed as a result of a massive blast at a Gaza hospital, as humanitarian concerns mount over Israel’s deprivation of food, fuel, and electricity to the enclave’s population. Al-Ahli Hospital was providing shelter to thousands who were displaced when it was bombed. The Ministry of Health in Palestine confirms that there are still a lot of people under the rubble.

Officials from Palestine said the incident was a result of the continuous airstrikes by Israel. Israel's defense forces however denied any involvement in the hospital attack and instead blamed the attack on a “failed rocket launch” by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group in Gaza.

Israel has laid siege to Gaza for over a week, in response to the deadly incursion by Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the coastal enclave, where 2.2 million people live.
