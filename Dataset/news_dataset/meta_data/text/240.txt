Wednesday, March 1, 2023 â€” Over 200 Indonesian children have died after ingesting cough syrup. Families recount similar stories of children consuming drugs; soon after, they could not pee, eat, or drink. They would begin to bleed profusely and would require dialysis regularly to survive.

At least 116 medications from six firms have been recalled due to excessive hazardous ingredients like diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol.

Twenty-five parents have joined a class action lawsuit against Indonesia's health ministry, food and drug agency, and eight pharmaceutical businesses, including some raw material suppliers, for their children's death and suffering. Parents expect the government and firms concerned to accept responsibility and improve production methods and illness control standards. 

The parents also want the incident to be designated as an "extraordinary event," implying that the government would fund all treatment costs. Presently, the parents state that treatment costs are funded by Indonesia's national health insurance, which is insufficient to cover co-morbidities and other expenditures.
