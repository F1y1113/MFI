Sunday, April 23, 2023 â€“ The agriculture ministers of the Group of Seven (G7) economic powers called for the extension, expansion, and full implementation of a critical deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea.

The deal, which United Nations and Turkey brokered, was signed in Istanbul last July, allowing Ukraine to have more than 27 million tons of grains exported from several of its Black Sea ports.

After a two-day meeting in Miyazaki, Japan, the G7 agricultural ministers in the communique recognized the importance of the continuation and full implementation of the grain Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI). A meeting is scheduled this week between the Russian Foreign Minister and U.N. Secretary-General to discuss the Ukrainian Black Sea export deal.

The G7 members are prepared to support the recovery and reconstruction of Ukraine, which includes providing expertise in the de-mining of agricultural land and the reconstruction of agricultural infrastructure.
