Friday, December 8, 2023 – President of Russia, Vladimir Putin has confirmed that he would stand again for a fifth term in power. He announced an award ceremony for participants of the full-scale war he launched against Ukraine in 2022. His announcement comes a day after election officials in Russia confirmed that the presidential election will be held on 15-17 March 2024.

Mr. Putin ruled the country from 2000 – 2008 and returned to power in 2012. This means he has been in power in Russia longer than any ruler since Josef Stalin. In 2020, the Russian constitution was amended, which increased the presidential term from four to six years. This gives Mr. Putin a clean slate to run again next year by canceling out his previous term.

Power was handed over to Mr. Putin at the very end of 1999 by his ailing predecessor, Boris Yeltsin.
