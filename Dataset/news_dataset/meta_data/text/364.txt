Monday, December 4, 2023 â€“ At least 47 people have been confirmed dead due to a severe flooding and landslide in northern Tanzania. 80 people were also wounded in the incident. The President of the country, Samia Hassan has deployed national security forces to help with rescue efforts. 

A rainfall that was higher than usual in Tanzania last month resulted in the deaths and destruction of property in the capital Dar es Salaam and the areas of Kigoma, Kagera, Geita, and Unguja. Crops have been washed away in some parts of the country, which affects the livelihood of the people.

According to a report, flooding is said to be the greatest natural disaster in Tanzania, which affects tens of thousands of people each year. In 2023, east Africa was badly hit by floods and landslides, partly caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon.
