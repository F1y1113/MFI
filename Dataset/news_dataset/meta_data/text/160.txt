Friday, September 30, 2022 – Four Ukraine regions that were under Russian occupation have been formally annexed by Russia in a move that received wide condemnation from the international community. On Friday, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, signed “accession treaties” with the region’s Moscow-installed leaders at a ceremony that was held in the Kremlin’s opulent St George’s Hall.

In a reaction from Kyiv, they launched a new, fast-track bid to join the NATO alliance. The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukraine had long been a “de-facto” member of the security bloc. He also added that Ukraine is taking a decisive step by signing Ukraine's application for accelerated accession to NATO."

Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary-General, was reluctant to be drawn on the bid. He said the decision lies with the bloc’s 30 members. He does, however, condemn the fact that Moscow annexed some of the Ukrainian territories and tagged the move as “the most serious escalation since the start of the war.”
